In this assignment, you'll be working to implement a fully connected neural network
model. This model will be used to fit 2D data of spiral points. The fit would be
visualized. So basically there would be some points in the 2D plane. You would
have to classify them based on their locations on the 2D plane.


Working files:
-------------
- You will be restricted to work with 'model.py' and 'main.py'.


Files to Submit:
---------------
'model.py' and 'model_nn.pkl'. 


Scoring:
-------
We'll run 'test.py' (included) to test your work on this assignment. You should have a working
neural network implementation and should have trained this model on the Spiral data.
We'll not train the network ourselves, instead use the weights provided by you.


Data:
----
Data is 2D, and is synthetically generated. You can go through 'main.py' for details.


Actual Work:
-----------
- Work through with 'model.py' and complete some functions.
- You can check your implementation by running:
  > python grad_check.py
- If your implementation is correct, you should proceed to work on 'main.py'.
- In this file, you'll have to specify the network architecture (number of layers) and
  the learning rate.
- Tune your hyperparameters to obtain the best possible precision on classifying the
  Spiral 2D data.
- Running 'main.py' would generate a file 'model_nn.pkl', which would contain the trained
  weights of your neural network.

PS: Although, you only need to work on two functions of model.py, you can edit all functions
    of that file, as long as you don't change their interface (function arguments and return
    values) and 'grad_check.py' okays your implementation.

Hint File:
---------
There is also a hint.pdf, that contains the mathematical workout for forward pass and
backpropogation for the neural network. You should consult Section 4 of this file for
completing 'main.py'.


All the best.
