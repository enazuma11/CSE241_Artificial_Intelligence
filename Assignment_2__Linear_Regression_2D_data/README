In this assignment, you'll be working to implement a basic linear regression model.
This model will be used to fit 2D data. The fits would be visualized. So basically
there would be some points in the 2D plane. You would find a curve that passes
through most of them (closely fits) them. Much like you used to do in your school
Physics experiments.

Working files:
-------------
You will be restricted to work with 'models.py' and 'linear_regression.ipynb'.
Once you work through the 'linear_regression.ipynb', a file named 'hyper_param.json'
would be generated.

Data:
----
Data is 2D, and is synthetically generated. You can go through 'utils.py' for details.

Actual Work:
-----------
- Complete some functions related to linear regression (predicting values, loss
  function and gradient descent)
- Feature extraction, pertaining to different problems.
- Tuning various parameters of the models in order to achieve the best results.

Steps:
---------
0. Open 'linear_regression.ipynb' via Jupyter Notebook.
1. Work through the 'linear_regression.ipynb' and follow the instructions therein.
2. Run your solution by running 'check_submission.py'. This will give you the test
   accuracy of your solutions on the four datasets used: Linear, Polynomial, Periodic
   and unknown. We'll judge your solutions by running this same file.
3. You need to submit the files: 'models.py' and 'hyper_param.json'.

NOTE: We will be testing your results by running 'check_submission.py' with the
      help of 'models.py' and 'hyper_param.json'. We will run train your weights for a
      fixed 200 epochs. So take care that you set your learning rates accordingly.

Hint File:
---------
There is also a hint.pdf, that contains the mathematical workout for linear
regression's forward (prediction) and backward (gradient descent) passes. Try to
complete the assignment without looking at it, but do consult it if you get stuck.


All the best.
