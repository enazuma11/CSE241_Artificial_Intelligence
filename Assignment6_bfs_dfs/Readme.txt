Assignment 6

In this assignment, you will implement dfs and bfs graph search algorithms.
Graph is constructed from an adjacency list @adj.
It is a directed graph and the adjacency list is constructed randomly.
In the graph class @self.graph is a dictionary where keys are numbers from 0 to #nodes-1 and the value is a set of nodes adjacent to the key node.

You have to generate single path from source to destination node in the form of a list.

Arigatou!
