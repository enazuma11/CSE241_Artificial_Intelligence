 Not content with having one album come out on Monday, and a smash hit single bestriding the charts like a funky colossus, Mark Ronson has another record due for imminent release. His soundtrack to the Johnny Depp/Gwyenth Paltrow film Mortdecai is scheduled for digital release next week, with a physical release to follow in February. It appears on Amazon with a release date of 17 February, with iTunes suggesting availability on January 20. The 18-track soundtrack was put together by Ronson and composer Geoff Zanelli. Rose Elinor Dougall of the Pipettes, who worked with Ronson on his Record Collection album in 2010, appears on one track, and Miles Kane appears on another. Ronson has, understandably, been quiet about the soundtrack, given he has his own “official” album Uptown Special to promote. The full tracklisting is: 1. Johanna (ft. Miles Kane)  2. Hong Kong  3. The Farmer’s Daughter  4. The Painted Lady May Be in Play  5. Spinoza  6. Los Angeles  7. Georgina  8. Heart’s a Liar (ft. Rose Elinor Dougall)  9. Curiously Interspersed With Erotic Dreams  10. Open Your Balls  11. Questionable Attack, Jock  12. The Duke’s Funeral  13. The Heist  14. Con Fuego  15. Well Spun Rumour  16. The Auction  17. Epilogue  18. In the Bathtub
