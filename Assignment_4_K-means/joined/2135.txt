 Marcelo Bielsa has resigned as manager of Lazio after just two days in the job, the Serie A club have confirmed. The 60-year-old was officially due to start in his new post on Saturday having been appointed as Stefano Pioli’s replacement at the Stadio Olimpico on Wednesday. However Bielsa has had a change of heart, living up to his reputation for eccentric behaviour in the process. He walked out on Marseille after just one match of the last Ligue 1 season. “We note with amazement the resignation of Mr Marcelo Bielsa … in a clear violation of the commitments undertaken in the agreements signed last week,” Lazio said in an official statement released on Friday. The club are considering taking legal action against the former Argentina manager, and have appointed former striker Simone Inzaghi as his replacement. Bielsa was due to arrive in Rome on Saturday and his coaching contract had already been filed with the Italian FA, the club confirmed. Prior to taking up the Lazio job, Bielsa was strongly linked with a second stint with Argentina after the departure of Gerardo Martino following their Copa América final loss to Chile. Bielsa had a six-year spell as Argentina boss between 1998 and 2004, guiding them to gold in the 2004 Olympics in Athens and to the final of the 2004 Copa América.
