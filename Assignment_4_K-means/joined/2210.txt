 Theresa May says she cannot guarantee the future of EU citizens living in the UK and that the question of their status will be a factor in Brexit negotiations (Report, 4 July). Might it be helpful if they were moved into resettlement camps ahead of her vision of an England free of the baleful influence of Europe, or at least have marks on the doors of their houses so that – if they are required to leave if prime minister May cannot extract desired concessions from 27 other EU states – they can be quickly rounded up?Dr Denis MacShaneLondon • Gove and Leadsom say a Brexiter should be PM because 17 million people voted for them. On the contrary. Those people will get what they voted for: the UK will leave the EU; but there was no endorsement in the referendum result for any terms of our subsequent relationship with the EU. A leader who supported remain is likely to do a better job of the negotiations with an angered EU and help assuage the justifiable anxieties of the 16 million who voted to stay in.Dr Maureen GuirdhamLondon • As a birth mother who gave up her baby for adoption, what Michael Gove has done (The betrayal, 1 July) resonates with me on a primitive psychological level. Cutting close ties requires both the ruthlessness and self-sacrifice that Gove has shown. Therefore the narrative is perhaps not one of assassination or fratricide, rather of relinquishment and dissociation. Nevertheless, there is always the hope (and dread) of reconciliation.Nicola WalkerYork • Are we to assume Cameron, Johnson and Farage (Nigel Farage resigns as Ukip leader, , 4 July) were never taught (a) to see a job through to completion, (b) to clear up any mess they made, because they could always expect to have minions to do that for them?Patrick WallaceLondon • Tim Farron: last man standing?Deb NicholsonBarrow Gurney, Somerset
