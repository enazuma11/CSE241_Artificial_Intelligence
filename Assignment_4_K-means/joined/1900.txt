The UK housing market has remained buoyant since the vote for Brexit as potential buyers have continued to snap up new homes, according to Taylor Wimpey. In a trading update, Britain’s third-biggest housebuilder said sales and cancellations since the 23 June referendum had barely changed from a year ago and that customers were confident. It said the effect of the vote was not yet clear but that the market’s long-term health was underpinned by strong demand.  Like other housebuilders, Taylor Wimpey noticed a brief faltering of demand straight after the Brexit vote followed by business picking up to normal levels. Before the referendum, remain campaigners warned of a housing shock if there was a vote to leave and some analysts have said a crash remains likely. Prices in some parts of central London have fallen and sales of “super prime” homes costing £10m or more have plunged but Taylor Wimpey said the mainstream market was holding up. In London’s zones one and two, prices have fallen slightly for the highest priced homes but demand remains strong, it said. Pete Redfern, Taylor Wimpey’s chief executive, said: “Trading during the second half of 2016 and into the autumn selling season has been strong. While there remains some uncertainty following the UK’s vote to leave the EU, we are encouraged to see that the housing market has remained robust and trading has remained resilient.” Taylor Wimpey said after almost 11 months of its financial year it had sold 0.75 properties a week at each of its developments compared with 0.76 for the same period last year. Cancellation rates stand at 13%, up slightly from 11% a year earlier. The company’s shares rose 3% to 150p. The shares plunged by more than a third to as low as 116p soon after the referendum as investors feared the vote would knock confidence in the property market. The company said it was sticking to its plan to pay £450m in dividends next year.
