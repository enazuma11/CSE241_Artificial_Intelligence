Ten candidates contested Lincolnshire seat vacated by Tory MP Stephen Phillips Press Association 
 Polls have closed in a parliamentary byelection triggered by the resignation of Conservative MP Stephen Phillips over “irreconcilable policy differences” with the government. Ten candidates contested the Sleaford and North Hykeham seat in Lincolnshire where the high-flying barrister had a majority of more than 24,000 at last year’s general election. The former MP supported Brexit but criticised ministers’ handling of the issue in parliament, as well as their approach to child refugees and targeting of foreign aid. Caroline Johnson, a consultant paediatrician, was chosen to defend the long-standing Tory seat, where Ukip is posing the biggest challenge. Ukip’s former leader, Nigel Farage, visited the seat to canvass support for the party’s candidate, Victoria Ayling, and suggested an upset was not impossible. “I don’t know, it’s 2016, why predict anything?” he said. “Only an idiot predicts things in 2016 because it’s been so full of upsets.” Labour fielded Jim Clarke, a GMB union member and refuse collection driver, while Ross Pepper, who works for an optician, represented the Liberal Democrats. The Green party did not field a candidate and gave its backing to an independent, Sarah Stock, who campaigned on a “Save the NHS” ticket. Theresa May will be hoping voters do not repeat the upset the Tories suffered in the Richmond Park byelection last week, which was was caused by the resignation of Zac Goldsmith in protest at the government’s decision to back a third runway at Heathrow airport. Goldsmith stood as an independent and the Conservatives did not field a candidate but he failed to stop the Liberal Democrats from taking back the seat.
