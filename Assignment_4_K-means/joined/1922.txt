 This week Aleks Krotoski is joined by Guardian tech reporters Alex Hern and Samuel Gibbs and telecoms correspondent Juliette Garside. From iris-scanning features on phones to curved screens, the team look at some of this years eye-catching launches at Mobile World Congress in Barcelona. Also we look at the growing importance of wearables and why increasingly the big car manufacturers are a big presence at this global tech and communications gathering. Finally Aleks and the team discuss why Mark Zuckerberg's congress Q&A gave so little away.
