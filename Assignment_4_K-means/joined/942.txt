 As BMW and Google race to get driverless cars on the road, and autonomous pods are set to be ushered onto the streets of Milton Keynes, artist Dominic Wilcox is fast forwarding to the future – 2059, to be precise, and 100 years since the original Mini, a source of his inspiration, was wheeled out. His hypothesis? That driverless cars are now commonplace. “In fact, there could well be motorways on which only driverless cars are allowed,” Wilcox explains. And with his stained-glass sleeper car, or Mini-Cathedral, he appears to have found a righteous partner for the ultra-safe freeways. Unveiled at last month’s London Design Festival, Wilcox’s vision for driverless cars is far from middle of the road. “If there are no collisions, designers will no longer be restricted by the need to include the safety equipment we see in modern-day cars,” he says. Ditching interior conventions – gone are the airbags, steering wheel and gear stick – he was free, as he puts it, to “create a living space on wheels”. The result? A glass car with a bed in it. From the mobile office to the Jacuzzi car, a sunbed on wheels to a cocktail bar, a host of ideas have come from Wilcox’s drawing board. But after embarking on a five-day crash course in traditional stained glass-making techniques to create the Durham Cathedral-inspired sleep-car, he says: “I don’t believe the technological future will only be slick, brushed aluminium, gadgety design.” The upshot is bright, bold and beautiful but you might need an eye-mask to get any kip. Dominic Wilcox’s, Variations on Normal, is out now.
