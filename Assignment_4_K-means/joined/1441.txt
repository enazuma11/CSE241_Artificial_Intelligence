 Boris Becker has urged fans not to be overexcited about Andrew Murray, the 18-year-old prodigy who caught the eye in the Stella Artois Championships this week, as the British public continue their increasingly desperate search for a new hero.  Yesterday saw Britain's ageing golden boy Tim Henman lose to Thomas Johansson, the Swede who had also beaten a tired and bruised Murray in Thursday's third round. But Becker played down the Scot's potential. "He is good," the German said, "but we shouldn't go overboard."  He said that heaping expectation on the teenager would encourage him but might backfire. "It is good and it is bad," said Becker. "It is good to get compliments and acclaim. It is also tempting to believe it all.  "There is a lot more tennis to be played," added the German, who will commentate on Wimbledon for the BBC. "It is only the beginning. Nothing else."  Becker is the right man to judge Murray at this stage. Twenty years ago this week he himself was the shock winner at Queen's as a 17-year-old before becoming the first unseeded player to triumph at Wimbledon.  He put things into further perspective by comparing Murray's level of performance with the current leading players' ability when they were at a similar stage to the Scot.  Becker rates Murray but is realistic. "[Roger] Federer was better at the same age," he said. "Lleyton Hewitt and [Andy] Roddick were better."  Although the three-times Wimbledon champion talked down Murray's prospects of a similar rise, he is stirred by the Scot. "I think he's an exciting, fresh personality," said Becker, who added that he did not know whether Henman had been better as a teenager.  "He seems to speak his mind as well. Even though everyone expected him to do well, he did well under pressure. That's the sign of a person who is comfortable in his own skin.  "Most importantly, he seems to be the best young player you have. It is correct to respect what he has achieved so far."
