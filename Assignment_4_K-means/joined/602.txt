 While writing about the film Drive, the Guardian's film critic Peter Bradshaw suggested "there is hardly a male pundit or columnist in Britain under 70 who hasn't declared a simpering man-crush on Ryan Gosling". It seems, as usual, the internet got there first. The "Hey Girl" meme, featuring photographs of the actor, his sensitively-chiselled cheekbones, and a wide selection of evening wear and body-clinging T-shirts, has proved remarkably persistent and, occasionally, quite funny. Surfacing on a tumblr called Fuck Yeah Ryan Gosling in 2008, the original pics feature Gosling with a bit of smooth-talking lothario text added alongside. It's mostly harmless fantasy (Ryan with baby and bottle – "Hey Girl, I got you"; Ryan in jacket – "Hey Girl, I can't wait to get home and give you a foot massage"). The internet being what it is, variants have since mushroomed. There's Silicon Valley Ryan Gosling ("Hey girl, unlike that patent your company just filed, there's nothing provisional about our love"; Feminist Ryan Gosling ("Hey girl, The post-feminist fetishisation of motherhood is deeply rooted in classism but I still think we'd make cute babies") and Ryan Gosling Works in Publishing (Hey Girl. No. That's not a book idea") Something tells me this isn't going away in a hurry.
