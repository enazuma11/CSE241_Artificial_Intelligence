 Is that noise the Bard spinning in his grave? Actually there's something about the broad, neon sensibility of this comedy, which bears as much relation to its near-namesake play as Corrie does to Coriolanus, that makes you wonder if he might be a bit tickled by it. In Cantonese, with some of the dinkiest, typo-tastic subtitles you'll see, it's a larky, bananas, downright dubious gender-bender curio about a girl who sets up a website to hook up women who need help doing bloke tasks like plumbing with men who are just lazing around crying and snoozing. The payment? Just a hug â€“ as represented by a flash graphic on the site that feels almost obscene in its sexlessness. It's like being hit repeatedly with an inflatable musical mallet. Eventually, you get used to it.
