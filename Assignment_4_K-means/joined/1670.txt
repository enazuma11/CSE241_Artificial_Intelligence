 Cricket South Africa (CSA) has suspended its domestic agreements with the Zimbabwe Cricket Union. CSA has traditionally been one of Zimbabwe's strongest backers, fighting against its international isolation and also signing bilateral agreements that allowed for development and administrative programmes in the embattled country and the participation of Zimbabwean teams in South Africa's domestic competitions. But Zimbabwe has been thrown into turmoil since its disputed general election in March, and the decision of the opposition MDC on Sunday to withdraw from a presidential run-off with Robert Mugabe amid fears of violence, appears to have been the motivating factor behind CSA's decision. "In the light of the worsening situation in Zimbabwe, CSA has reviewed its position in relation to Zimbabwe cricket. We have decided to suspend our bilateral agreements with the Zimbabwe Cricket Union until further notice," said the president of CSA, Norman Arendse, in a statement released today. "In the past, CSA has defended Zimbabwe cricket against heavy odds, but the general situation in Zimbabwe has now made this untenable. We will continue to comply with the International Cricket Council's future tours programme regarding Zimbabwe, as we are bound to this programme as a full member of the ICC."  South Africa's next series with Zimbabwe is not scheduled until September 2010, in South Africa.
