 Assassin's Creed has become a divisive franchise, developer Ubisoft's yearly release cycle leading to accusations of watering down the series' quality in favour of a stable income. Observing the shortcomings in Assassin's Creed IV: Black Flag – simplistic combat, badly structured mission types, an awkward sci-fi metafiction imposed on an otherwise solid story – one would be forgiven for thinking these accusations hold weight. Yet for every failure, there is a greater success. Taking place during the Caribbean's "Golden Age of Piracy" (around 1700-1718), Black Flag offers players control of devil-may-care swashbuckler Edward Kenway. You plunder your way around a huge map featuring Cuba, Jamaica, the tip of Florida, the Bahamas and countless other islets and coves. It's this intoxicating mixture of sun-bleached vistas, shanties and raucous characters that elevates the game's tone above that of several more earnest predecessors. The story is entertaining and rips along at a pace, although the real joy comes from picking a random direction and sailing off to engage in unscripted adventure. As unhinged as a rum-sodden buccaneer, entirely imperfect and yet charming in its flawed excess, the old tub may have wind in her sails yet.
