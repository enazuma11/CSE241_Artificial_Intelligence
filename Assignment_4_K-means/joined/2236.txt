 It will be deja vu for Britain's Andy Murray tomorrow if he meets Sweden's Thomas Johansson in the first round of the Nottingham Open, which begins today. However, the chances of him being fit to play in the tournament were still in the balance last night. The 18-year-old Scot's MRI scan revealed there was no lasting damage to the left ankle he injured during his third round Stella Artois match last Thursday. His spectacular fall, coupled with severe cramp, ruined Murray's chances of reaching the quarter-finals when he was within two points of defeating Johansson.  Johansson went on to beat Tim Henman before losing to Croatia's Ivo Karlovic in the semi-finals on Saturday. The 30-year-old Swede boasts a good record at Nottingham, having won the title in 2001 and reaching the final last year, where he lost to Thailand's Paradorn Srichaphan.  Murray, who has played only four matches on the ATP Tour, three of them at Queen's last week, has been having underwater physio therapy at the private Roehampton club, but the injury may need more time to heal fully. He has a wild card into Nottingham as well as for Wimbledon, which begins a week today.  Clearly he would love to play at Nottingham, but it would be pointless at this stage of his career to jeopardise his chances of making his Wimbledon main draw debut simply for the sake of chasing ATP points and a higher ranking.  The Nottingham organisers, the Lawn Tennis Association - who are suddenly swarming around Murray like bees around a hive - and Sky TV are all anxious he should play, while Murray will be keen to build on his success at Queen's where he defeated Santiago Ventura of Spain and Taylor Dent of the US.
