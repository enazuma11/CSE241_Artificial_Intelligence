 Age: With her all her life. So 36. Appearance: The leg that launched a thousand tweets. Is this the Angelina from Brangelina? It is indeed. The actor, director and UN goodwill ambassador? That's the one. And what's happened to her leg? It has emerged as the unexpected breakthrough star of Sunday's Oscars ceremony. How did it manage that? By being flaunted at every possible opportunity. Jolie's dress – a jet-black Atelier Versace ball gown – exposed her right leg all the way up to the thigh, and the film star spent most of the evening making quite sure everybody knew about it. On the red carpet, and later on stage, she stopped again and again to pose hand-on-hip with the bare leg jutting forward. Sounds classy. It didn't look classy. It looked like she was limbering up for a jog. Or about to dance a jig. Or attempting to trip someone. Oh dear. Did people make fun of her? Immediately. The leg began trending on Twitter while she was still on the red carpet, and things only got worse when the winners of the award she had presented mimicked her pose in their acceptance speech. From there, the internet did what it does best: it churned out jokes at the rate of a robot Robin Williams. Such as? Such as giving the leg its own Twitter account – @angiesrightleg – tweeting "Check me out! Leg!!" and "I'm a leg, get a load of me!!" and gaining more than 25,000 followers in the process. Then it was doctored-photo-fun time? You guessed it. At least two new photo memes were spawned. First off, "leg-bombing" on Pinterest, which covers inserting the leg into photos of landmarks and famous faces, then over on Tumblr, "Angelina Jolieing", which specialises in photos of normal people recreating the pose in their living rooms. And how is the leg coping with its newfound global fame? Apparently it is holding up pretty well. Do say: "And the Oscar for best supporting of an actress goes to ..." Don't say: "... Meryl Streep, for the role of the left leg in Angie's Right Leg: The Movie."
