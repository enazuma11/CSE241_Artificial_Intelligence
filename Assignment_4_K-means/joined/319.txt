Harriet Gibsone 
 Sam Genders, formerly of folk experimentalists Tunng and now making indie-electronica as Diagrams, sees the world in ornate detail. His perspective is symbolised neatly in the artwork for his second album – a hand delving into the unknown depths of a rectangular prism – suggesting an introspection that goes beyond Chromatics’ surface theme of relationships. The music moves from musings about “spectral mist” and existential despair on Serpent (“Going to climb outside myself/ Burn my worries, leave my fears/ Evaporate and disappear”) to more earthbound woe and wonder on Brain (“Pigeons outside, eating the seeds that you threw/ I want to know, what did I do?”). Foreboding as his lyrics often are, there is enormous hope at the heart of this music, and its gentle, almost Elbow-like melodies transform his worries into a warm, soft sanctuary.
