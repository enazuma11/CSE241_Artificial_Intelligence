 Warwickshire's Ian Bell was out for just seven in today's game against Hampshire, hours after admitting he is "desperate" to play a role in England's Ashes campaign. Bell was dropped by England after their embarrassing defeat in Jamaica in February, but has been in eye-catching form for Warwickshire this season. He was named as the spare batsman for both Tests against Australia at Cardiff and Lord's, and England's coach, Andy Flower, has confirmed that Bell will step up if Kevin Pietersen is not passed fit. Pietersen will meet his specialist this week amid growing speculation that he will not be passed fit for the third Test, which starts on 30 July. "I know this might sound strange but I want Kevin to be playing for England," Bell said yesterday. "But if his injury proves beyond him, then I am just as desperate to play. Having faced the Aussies before I know what to expect from them, and once you have appeared at Test level you want to carry on playing against the best players in the world." "I am in great form at the moment so I would not worry about being called into the team."
