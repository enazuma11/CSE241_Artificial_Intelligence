The follow-up to their acclaimed feature debut, Black Pond, sees directing duo Will Sharpe and Tom Kingsley reunite on another offbeat oddity that combines piercingly funny observation with unashamed weirdness. Sharpe, who also co-wrote the film, stars as Zac, a city banker in the throes of a breakdown as he searches for his missing sister, Alice (Tiani Ghosh). It’s episodic and fractured, but this tale of romance and loss is really rather lovely. It’s also very amusing: Zac’s marriage proposal to his girlfriend is perhaps the most catastrophically awkward moment of botched intimacy I have seen this year. Zac’s website footage is deftly incorporated into a film that reveals its hand satisfyingly slowly.
