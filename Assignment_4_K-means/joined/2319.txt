 Katie Swan will become the youngest British player in Fed Cup history after Johanna Konta withdrew from this weekâ€™s pool matches in Israel. The US-based Swan will play in the Euro/Africa Zone Group 1 tie against South Africa on Thursday at the age of 16 years and 316 days, beating the record of Anne Keothavong by 270 days. Swan will feature alongside the British No2 Heather Watson and the doubles pair of Jocelyn Rae and Anna Smith. The Bristol-born teenager was called up by GB captain, Judy Murray, to fill the second singles spot after Konta, who reached the Australian Open semi-finals, withdrew because of an intestinal problem. Britain need to overcome Georgia and South Africa to progress to a play-off match on Saturday and possible promotion to the World Group II play-offs in April.
