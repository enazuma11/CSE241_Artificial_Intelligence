Two new entries displace long-running hits from Ed Sheeran and Mark Ronson 
Guardian music 
 This week’s charts bring new entries at No 1 in both the singles and albums charts. Ellie Goulding’s Love Me Like You Do has become the fastest selling single of the year to enter the charts at the top, whereas one singer-songwriter has knocked another young enough to be his grandson off the albums peak, with Bob Dylan’s Shadows in the Night replacing Ed Sheeran’s X. Shadows in the Night, Dylan’s album of songs associated with Frank Sinatra, is his eighth UK No 1 album. 2006’s Together Through Life also reached No 1, but before then he had not topped the UK charts since 1970, when New Morning hit No 1. There were three other new entries in the albums top 40: Kid Ink’s Full Speed (No 10), Indiana’s No Romeo (No 17) and Diana Krall’s Wallflower (No 19). Goulding’s single Love Me Like You Do has displaced Mark Ronson’s Uptown Funk after seven weeks. It comes from the soundtrack to the movie adapation of Fifty Shades of Grey. It’s joined in the top 20 by another track from the movie: the Weeknd’s Earned It (No 18).
