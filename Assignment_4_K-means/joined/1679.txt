 Bookmarking app Instapaper has apologised to users after a recommendation algorithm went awry, delivering a profanity-filled story to the inbox of subscribers to the site’s email newsletter. Instapaper Weekly, introduced in January 2014, algorithmically picks the most popular stories saved to the the app over the previous week, and emails them out to users. Every new user since December 2013 has been automatically signed up to the mailing list, which goes out every Monday. In late January, however, the site’s users collectively demonstrated a bit of a potty-mouth, pushing an article by author Mark Manson to the top of the email. The title? “The Subtle Art of Not Giving a Fuck”. The following week’s email led with an apology. “The top highlight in last week’s email contained some … colourful language, and we’re sorry if you were offended,” the Instapaper team wrote. “The Weekly is an algorithmically generated newsletter based on the most popular articles and highlights saved by Instapaper users, and unfortunately we didn’t build the algorithm to filter profanity in any way. “We’ve added in some filters on our end to ensure that future content remains as interesting as ever, while avoiding any potentially offensive language. Again, we are sincerely sorry if you were offended, we’re still getting the taste of soap out of our mouths!” Badly filtered recommendations have led to trouble in other domains. Weeks after Twitter’s first video-sharing service, Vine, launched, the company had to hurriedly turn off an “editor’s picks” feature after it pushed hardcore pornography to the top of every user’s feed. But before we celebrate the failure of robots too soon, Vine’s mistake turned out to have been human error. Between potty-mouthed robots and dirty-minded humans, your recommendations may never be fully safe.
