 Welcome to the newest member of the Guardian’s podcast family: Chips with Everything, a new incarnation of our long-running technology show, hosted by the brilliant Leigh Alexander and Olly Mann. In putting this new show together, we’ve used the huge amount of responses we received to our call-to-action, when we asked Guardian podcast listeners for their ideas. Thank you for all the feedback – we listened carefully to what you had to say, and Chips with Everything is the result. On the new show, we will continue to offer you the most engaging and influential stories from the digital space, but we’ll also hone in on the human stories behind tech. It’s our way of exploring what happens when people and technology collide. We’ll be bringing you stories about how technology influences and impacts our lives on a daily basis; how the digital world around us makes our lives better, or often not so much. Plus, the occasional long-form interview, and much, much more. Finally, we’re always on the hunt for intriguing, exciting and unusual stories to cover. Has tech influenced your life in a weird and wonderful way? Tweet us @guardianaudio. You can also email me here.
