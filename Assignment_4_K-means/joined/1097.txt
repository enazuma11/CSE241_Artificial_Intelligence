 After a stuttering first-round performance against Italian qualifier Andreas Seppi in the Masters Series in Hamburg, today's second-round tie with Andre Pavel proved a match too far for Tim Henman. Henman, seeded fifth for the tournament, has struggled with a heavy cold and did not put up much of a fight as Pavel took the match 6-2, 6-2.  He was broken in the first game and made unforced errors throughout the match, which took the Romanian only 47 minutes to wrap up. Pavel took the second game without too much difficulty, but Henman recovered from his slow start and reduced the deficit, albeit in less-than-convincing fashion.  A comfortable-looking Pavel went further ahead at 3-1, but Henman seemed to have found his rhythm when he took the fifth without reply.  But his opponent barely broke stride in regaining his two-game advantage and went three ahead after Henman recovered from three break points down only to lose the seventh with a double fault.  Henman produced 16 unforced errors to Pavel's one and the Romanian's near-flawless service game signalled the end of a short first set.  The second set started the same way as the first with Pavel, this time varying his shots more, breaking Henman's serve before taking the second without answer.  The British No1 looked tired but he remained aggressive instead of trying to slow the game down and halt the Pavel juggernaut.  The match then went without incident until Henman surrendered his serve in the seventh game to fall 5-2 behind, and world No13 Pavel had no problem in serving out for the match.
