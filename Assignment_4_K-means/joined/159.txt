Newcastle and Gateshead have been chosen to host the Great Exhibition of the North, a huge exhibition showcasing art, design and innovation in the north of England. The £5m, two-month exhibition will be staged in the summer of 2018 and was first announced by the former chancellor George Osborne last November as part of his “northern powerhouse” initiative. Announcing the host the culture secretary, Karen Bradley, said the exhibition would “showcase the dynamic arts, cultural and design scenes in the city and across the whole of the north”. To reflect on this, we’d like to hear your thoughts about how the region could or should be best celebrated. What are your hopes and expectations of the exhibition? How do you feel it can best reflect or celebrate the region’s arts and culture? Perhaps you are from a part of the north which you don’t feel has enough exposure and would like to highlight some particular work? What does it mean for a cultural asset to be particularly “northern”? You can share your thoughts using the form below and we’ll put together an article on the Guardian with some of the most interesting.  If there is a particular piece of art that you feel represents the north you can also upload a picture via GuardianWitness. Click on the blue contribute buttons to add yours.
