 Rafael Nadal extended his record unbeaten run on clay yesterday to 69 matches when he cruised to a 6-1, 6-4 victory over Sweden's Thomas Johansson to reach the quarter-finals of the Barcelona Open. The top seed, aiming to become only the second player to win the title in three successive years, lost only five points on his serve as he marched into the last eight. The Spaniard said that improving his record did not create any extra pressure. "When I step on the court I don't think about records," he said.  Nadal will now play Potito Starace after the Italian upset the eighth seed Juan Ignacio Chela of Argentina 6-4 7-6, clinching victory on his fifth match point.
