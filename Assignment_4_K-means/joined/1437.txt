London mayor says choice facing Britain is not just about financial issues but also the kind of country UK wants to be

 Leaving the EU would be a betrayal of British values and send a message to the world that the country wants to stand alone, Sadiq Khan, the mayor of London, has said.  The senior Labour politician said the choice facing Britain was not just about the financial consequences of leaving but the kind of country the UK wanted to be.  He said it was “quintessentially British” and part of our “values, our character, and our open and outward-facing nature that we can’t help but embrace our European neighbours”. Khan said the leave campaign believed it had a “monopoly on patriotism”, with a nostalgic vision of Britain being able to rule itself again, but the “true patriotic case” was to remain. He said it was the right thing for our “heart as well as for our head”. In his speech in central London, Khan made clear he was separating his arguments from those of David Cameron and Conservative remain campaigners, who have been issuing dire warnings about the consequences of leaving.  He said Britain would survive outside the EU but it would be a weaker place.  Amid concerns in the remain camp about turnout among the young, Khan urged people to register to vote to make the right decision for their children and grandchildren.
