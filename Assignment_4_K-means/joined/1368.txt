 BBC4 will screen Antigone, the already-acclaimed production of Sophocles’s play beginning at London’s Barbican this week. Starring Juliette Binoche as the title character, determined to honour her dead brother despite opposition from the ruling Creon, the production features a new translation by poet Anne Carson and is directed by Ivo van Hove, whose boldly minimalist take on Arthur Miller’s A View From The Bridge is another current London hit. Reviewing the production for the Guardian, Michael Billington gave it four stars, saying it “combines a sombre aesthetic beauty with a sense of the ambivalence... its success rests on its ability to re-imagine ways of staging Greek tragedy and on rendering Sophocles’s play as a work that is puzzling, profound and at the same time full of unresolved political questions.” Toni Racklin, head of theatre at the Barbican, heralded a “ground-breaking collaboration [which] means that the production will reach an even wider audience, supporting our mission to inspire more people to discover and love the arts.” The screening, coming later this spring, will be part of a whole season of BBC4 programming entitled The Age of Heroes: Ancient Greece Uncovered. Other shows include Natalie Haynes on how contemporary obsessions with beauty date back to the era, Alastair Sooke exploring the great treasures of ancient Greek art, and former Apprentice judge Margaret Mountford telling the life story of Sappho. After its London run ends on 28 March, Antigone will head on an international tour to Antwerp, Amsterdam, Paris, the Ruhrfestspiele festival in Germany, the Edinburgh festival, and finally a series of dates across the US.
