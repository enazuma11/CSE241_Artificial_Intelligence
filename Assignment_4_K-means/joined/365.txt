Prolific Brit producer Jonathan Willis here attempts a teen-oriented tweak of the science-gone-wrong theme of his 2013 success The Machine. It’s about the doomed Posterity Project, a programme that sequesters the best and brightest youngsters in the US underground. While their twentysomething handlers uncover the project’s deadlier glitches, director Martin Owen applies plentiful visual gloss. A first-person shooting style necessitates intricate, Peep Show-like eyeline-matching, and the effects work is unusually sophisticated. Yet there’s no dressing up some desperately ordinary stalk-and-slashing, and the budget undermines the world-building: ex-EastEnder Kara Tointon heads a roster of phony US accents, and while Kids in America gets repeat plays, surely nobody here ventured much beyond Amersham.
