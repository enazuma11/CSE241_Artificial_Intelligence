 By 52 to 48 per cent, Britain has voted to leave the European Union. Despite big pro-EU votes in London and Scotland, Leave supporters could be found in all parts of England and Wales in numbers that shocked pollsters and politicians alike. So what happens now? Joining Tom Clark to discuss it all are Guardian political editor Heather Stewart; columnists Matthew D’Ancona and Hugh Muir and Brussels correspondent Jennifer Rankin.  Also this week: as David Cameron announces a timetable for his departure by the end of the year, Boris Johnson is in pole position to assume the Conservative leadership and become prime minister. Meanwhile, Labour MPs are planning a vote of no confidence in their leader Jeremy Corbyn and the SNP’s Nicola Sturgeon is openly discussing the prospect of a new Scottish independence referendum.
