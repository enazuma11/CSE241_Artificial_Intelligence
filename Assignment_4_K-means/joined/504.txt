 Maria Sharapova is headed to Harvard Business School for a two-week course this summer.  The 29-year-old posted on Facebook and Twitter on Saturday a picture of her seated next to a sign for the school and the message: “Not sure how this happened but Hey Harvard! Can’t wait to start the program!” Not sure how this happened but Hey Harvard! Can't wait to start the program! 🎓📓 pic.twitter.com/EOoKYhaQli  Her agent Max Eisenbud said on Monday that the program involves two classes on campus. Eisenbud wasn’t clear what certification, if any, she’d earn from the coursework.  Harvard have yet to comment on the matter.  Sharapova was handed a two-year ban by the International Tennis Federation after she tested positive for meldonium at the Australian Open in January. The substance had been banned at the start of 2016.  The five-time Grand Slam champion and former world No1 has appealed the ban.
