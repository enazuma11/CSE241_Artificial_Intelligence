 The two latest offshoots from the ever-malleable Kirby franchise will be recognisable to Kirby Triple Deluxe players – both of these new eShop titles were mini-games in the excellent 2014 3DS game. Dedede’s Drum Dash Deluxe is a rhythm action/platformer hybrid that sees you jump and bounce your way through seven songs from the Kirby series, all the while avoiding enemies and racking up point bonuses. Kirby Fighters Deluxe is essentially a Super Smash Bros-lite fighting game, starring Kirby as the sole playable character. Players can pick one of 10 different abilities (each with its own move set) and then fight their way through the other nine Kirbys and two bosses. There’s a new four-player mode for this release, but don’t go expecting anything as sophisticated as Smash. While both were perfect as bite-size bonuses in their source game, neither is compelling enough to really warrant a solo outing. Unlike the exceptional Captain Toad, which made the similar jump from bonus to standalone release, the additional content here is minimal and the core concepts haven’t been expanded on in any significant way.
