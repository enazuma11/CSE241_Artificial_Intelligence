 After months of disarray, Ukip has announced that Paul Nuttall is its new leader – and his immediate plan is to target northern England’s Labour heartlands. So how worried should Labour be? We hear from Manchester University’s Robert Ford, author of Revolt on the Right. Also this week, Labour’s shadow Brexit secretary, Sir Keir Starmer, tells us that Theresa May should act unilaterally to guarantee residency rights for any EU nationals already living in Britain and end the uncertainty about their status after Brexit. Joining Heather Stewart to discuss it all are Guardian columnist Rafael Behr, leader writer Anne Perkins and James Morris, a former adviser to Ed Miliband and now a partner at polling firm Greenberg Quinlan Rosner Research. Plus: political reporter Jessica Elgot hears from candidates and voters ahead of the Richmond Park byelection result.  And we hear from Stephanie Kirchgaessner on what Italy’s constitutional referendum will do for the country’s increasingly anti-establishment mood and what it means for the eurozone.  Finally, we have a live Politics Weekly podcast event coming up on Tuesday 13 December. To buy your tickets click here. Leave your thoughts below.
