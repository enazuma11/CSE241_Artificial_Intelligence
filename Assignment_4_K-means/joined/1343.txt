 While Jeremy Corbyn opposed the government’s policy on tax credits, it would be a bit much for his supporters to claim that “he deserves credit for government U-turns on tax credits” (Eagle’s exit leaves Smith sole Corbyn challenger, 20 July) without acknowledging that it was the government’s defeat in the Lords on an amendment moved by Labour peer Patricia Hollis that triggered the eventual climb down.Jeremy BeechamLabour, House of Lords • Brian Smith believes that Keith Flett might be writing to you regarding PMs and beards (Letters, 20 July). During this hot spell, Mr Flett and other beard-wearers may be far more preoccupied with the dangers of beard wax melting and dripping on to open-toed sandals, thus causing minor burns and consequently undue pressure on an already overburdened NHS.Toby WoodPeterborough, Cambridgeshire • While Keith Flett is busy sharpening his pen, may I point out that there have in fact been three prime ministers since 1721 who sported beards: Lord Salisbury, Benjamin Disraeli and Lord Palmerston. No Whigs, however, since 1858.Adrian BrodkinLondon • The British system does not elect prime ministers but parties. In that sense it is not Jeremy Corbyn’s formidable beard power that matters but his principles.Keith FlettLondon • Ted Watson (Letters, 16 July) says that we should support Corbyn because people want someone to represent many of his positions on Trident, on renationalisation, on inequality – but that they want someone with strategy and presence. What about Caroline Lucas?Liz ReasonCharlbury, Oxfordshire • The Palmerstone quote that Professor Alan Knight refers to (Letters, 19 July) is fuller in its original form: “We have no eternal allies, and we have no perpetual enemies. Our interests are eternal and perpetual, and those interests it is our duty to follow.”Harry WilesEsher, Surrey • Join the debate – email guardian.letters@
