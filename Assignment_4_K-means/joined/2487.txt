 Pictures just in from Leicester’s squad going out for lunch at the San Carlo Pizzeria in the city. They’re not alone … Updated
 José Mourinho has offered his congratulations to Leicester and Claudio Ranieri, via a CAA Sports UK statement which read: I want to congratulate everyone connected to LCFC; players, staff, owners and fans. I lost my title to Claudio Ranieri and it is with incredible emotion that I live this magic moment in his career. A bit different to his comments in 2008, when he described Ranieri as having “the mentality of someone who doesn’t need to win”: He is almost 70 years of age. He has won a Supercup and another small trophy, and he is too old to change his mentality. 
 The latest Football Weekly podcast is here, with James Richardson joined by John Ashdown, Paolo Bandini, Philippe Auclair and Iain Macintosh to discuss all things Leicester. Updated
 Leicester manager Claudio Ranieri and his players have been talking after making it in for training today. Ranieri: It means the job is good. I am very, very happy now because maybe if I won this title at the beginning of my career maybe I would forget. Now I am an old man I can feel it much better. I said every time I am very happy for the fans, for the chairman and for all the Leicester community. I don’t know the secret. The players, the heart, the soul and how they play. My message to the fans is now to keep going, we want to improve a lot. Midfielder Danny Drinkwater on watching the title being secured: It was brilliant, all the lads were together whilst it happened and it kind of sums us up as a group of lads. I’ve not [known a bond like it], and I think the rest of the lads would answer the question the same. It’s a special moment for us lot. Vice-chairman Aiyawatt Srivaddhanaprabha on what comes next:  We are not a team who produces players to be developed later by other teams. All players want to stay and keep on fighting together to see how far they can go. So selling players is not on our agenda. Updated
 I just scoured my spam folder and found a whole hidden bunch of Leicester City fans who had sent celebratory emails. In no particular order, let’s start with Simon Lake, from Australia, who for some reason is reminded of Basic Instinct. Why? Read on: I’m writing from a foxhole in Brisbane having taken an emergency day’s leave to help soak up the events of this morning, along with the previous nine months. I’m currently ‘Home Alone’ with my friends ‘Breakfast, Lunch & Dinner’ (see below). It’s difficult to know where to begin except to say that I’ve felt compelled to utilise the ‘Love’ icon on Facebook for the first time. It’s also the first time I’ve ever submitted an e-mail to a ‘Blog’. Do I get a badge or something? I’m not sure how this area of life operates - must I cough up a special memory to get it published? Would it help if I told you that the first ‘18’ rated film I saw at the cinema was ‘Basic Instinct’ and I had my sleeping bag in tow? The film was utter tosh but it whiled away a couple of hours before heading down to Filbert Street where tickets were going on sale the following morning for Leicester’s 1992 Wembley play-off final against Blackburn Rovers. Arriving at 11pm, I thought we were early, only to find we were still down the street and around the corner. I also thought we were well prepared until a couple rocked up with a double bed and proceeded to assemble it on the pavement. I was mildly surprised that someone didn’t appear in the morning to serve them breakfast! There have been highs and lows, but as the saying goes: ‘Foxes Never Quit’. So proud of Claudio and team! As an aside, if any of your readers are travelling to Leicester from Brisbane this weekend, have a spare airline ticket and want to talk football all the way, then I’m your man! I’m totally happy to travel economy and am confident that I could offer a ‘good time’. I need to be back for work on Monday though! Is that asking a lot? Paul Lennon writes from Moscow, where he teaches theory of knowledge at the city’s Anglo-American School. He expects to see Leicester tops cropping up in PE soon:  Working at The Anglo American School here in Moscow means we see all the different football shirts on display every day in PE. To this point not one Leicester top! Soon to change after last night and the season as a whole. A brilliant example to these young people from 60 odd different countries that leadership, team work, belief, quality, tactical intelligence, speed, movement and fitness can provide a platform for impossible dreams to come true. Welcome to visit our School any time King Claudio! Elsewhere in Russia, in the town of Votinsk, in the Udmurt Republic, Andrew Beznosov is celebrating with fish pie. He writes:  Hello from Russian town Votkinsk, where we are celebrating this incredible victory! This is a fishy pie with ‘lavrushka’. Arne Anka from Sweden says he can finally hold his head up around his friends who support Premier League big dogs like Liverpool and Manchester United: I started watching English football in the 1970s on Swedish television as a teenager, and then, for some reason, LCFC became my team. I followed them through good and bad, both in England and on TV and thought that the two League cups would be the best they’d ever do. And my Swedish friends, all ManU, Liverpool, Arsenal etc fans...they have always asked me why? Why do you support that team??? Now they know!!!! .I’ve been up all night...Party Vardy Party LCFC! And finally, a rebuke from one reader who objects to the inclusion of glory-hunting politicians who have appeared on this blog. Marco Grandi writes:  It would be good if you avoid giving coverage to politicians (whether left or right / Labour or tory) who congratulates Leicester or tries to get onto Leicester bandwagon. It is ridiculous and an insult to us fans. Zac Goldsmith as you put it does not even know where QPR plays, and it would probably have no idea what LCFC has achieved. Somebody has written him a script this morning so that he can connects with normal people in his messages. Be adult, be intelligent, and avoid putting that shit up. Thanks. 
 The news is still sinking in for Leicester fans. This contribution comes from Prakash Shah, who doesn’t give his location but I’m guessing he’s a Leicester man:  I’ve followed Leicester for 37 years. I went to my first game when Gordon Milne was in charge and Steve Lynex and Alan Smith were leading the line. My friends and I used to walk home up the treelined New Walk dissecting the game and dodging the police cordon for the away fans around the station. This was at the old Filbert St and we’d recall moments of games past, always dreaming of this day. This feeling that Man U, Chelsea and Liverpool fans (at least the older ones) and CIty feel is their right was always just a dream for us. Just a dream. It isn’t today. I didn’t go to many games this year, with kids and family and working away it just isn’t possible, but inside, there’s still that hope, then nerves and last night ... realisation. I had a silent mosh pit around my living room (as the family were in bed - it’s a school night) with my arms aloft. That’s the feeling I want as a fan. That’s why I love football. Dreams and feelings. Now we have a title. We made history. We’ll never be forgotten and I’ll remember. I have this. Wow. And the Foxes’ army of overseas fans are still writing in, as well. Saurav Samaddar, from India, says he hopes the credit for the victory will go to Leicester boss Claudio Ranieri. I hope this title gives Ranieri his due as one of the great tacticians of the game. Discussions about his (hopefully now dead) reputation as a nearly man have always ignored the fact that in nearly each of those cases, he had his teams punching above their weight, as opposed to underachieving and falling short. Leicester’s team spirit which was carefully maintained and honed is a significant part of this success, but so is Ranieri getting the tactics just right each time. Also, hope Nigel Pearson is invited to the celebrations to acknowledge his contributions to the making of this team. 
 More on Jamie Vardy’s Premier League party last night. Admittedly, this one is pure speculation by our cricket writer, Elizabeth Ammon. The recycling bin outside Jamie Vardy's house this morning pic.twitter.com/iuLXdSuqof 
 Leicester City’s Premier League won led to a near doubling of Twitter activity in the UK, the microblogging service has said. According to Twitter’s data team, there were 5.5m tweets sent in response to the Foxes’ unexpected victory last night. They have put together this special tribute visualisation made out of congratulatory tweets from fans around the world. Twitter activity in the UK surged 86% beyond its normal level, Twitter said, with as many tweets mentioning the word “party” as there were at last New Year’s Eve.  Leicester’s own victory Tweet became one of the most retweeted sporting tweets in Twitter history, collecting more than 380,000 retweets by the time of writing. Leicester City. Champions of England. pic.twitter.com/WRwfysTn2N 
 Life-changing is a bit of hyperbole that gets bandied around quite a lot in sports coverage. But for one Leicester fan, Lee Herbert, the Foxes’ win has quite literally changed his life.  Herbert was prescient enough to lay a £5 bet on Leicester winning the Premier League right at the start of the season, when they were battling odds of 5,000-1. Now, after cashing in part of the bet early, he’s walked away with £20,600, which he says he will use as the downpayment on a house for him and his fiancee. Asked what spurred him to place the bet, Herbert told Radio 5 Live this morning:  I’d seen them come up from the Championship and they played brilliant in the Championship. They were trying to find their feet in their first season in the Premier League and they pulled off the great escape. And then they got Ranieri in as manager, and I just thought they have got something there, I could tell. I saw the odds at 5,000-1 and just thought however’s put those odds on are not giving them enough credit. Herbert admitted that he was plagued with the temptation to cash in his bet early, despite early in the season telling himself he would let it ride all the way to the finish. “But when it got to Easter the cash-out value was £14,500, and being a Leicester fan you get let down sometimes,” he said. “I just thought I could lose everything.” He took two pounds out - netting him winnings of £5,600 - and let the remaining £3 go all the way. Asked what he would do with the cash, Herbert said: I’m going to enjoy some of it. We are going to have a party next Saturday. But most of the money is going to go towards a deposit on a house for me and Kerry, my fiancee. Updated
 The Leicester City bandwagon is rolling, and politicians are keen to jump on. Tory London mayoral candidate Zac Goldsmith, who has taken a hammering over accusations of racial stereotyping in his campaign against Labour rival Sadiq Khan, told LBC News this morning that he is hoping to replicated the Foxes’ unexpected success.  Zac Goldsmith says “I’m hoping to do a bit of a Leicester City, zoom in from behind and win” https://t.co/ccRUGeu5ZW pic.twitter.com/OuMlLVeSxm As my colleague Matthew Weaver points out, this from the man who man who didn’t know which football team plays at Loftus Road...  
 Foxes fans from around the World continue to get in touch with their stories, including this beautiful scene described by Leicester City fan Sunil Suri, who was at Stamford Bridge last night. Sunil writes: I was at Old Trafford on Sunday and thought I’d chance it and get a ticket to the Chelsea-Spurs game. I was sat in Shed End lower tier with the Chelsea fans who made it feel like a Leicester home game. I was wearing my Leicester shirt and so become something of an adopted mascot. Towards the end of the game someone lifted me onto their shoulders and hundreds of fans pointed at me and sang “Leicester City, we’ll win it for you”. It was pretty amazing. Unfortunately, my phone was dead, so I was wondering if you could put this on your live blog on the off chance that one of the many Chelsea fans who filmed the scene/took a photo might send it in to you. If not, never mind, somewhat etched in my memory. Thanks for the live blog, I’ve barely slept all night and now ran out to get the morning papers. Still real. Comments and congratulations are coming in from all around the world. Abishek Dubey emailed us from Hong Kong to say:  Been a crazy year. Expected the foxes to reach the Champions league, but this is unbelievable. Even after watching the players celebrate at vardy’s place, I felt like this is all a dream. I guess until I don’t see Wes Morgan lifting the trophy, I won’t believe it. Morgan, the same guy who gave away a penalty at Anfield last year when the ball hit his face. I am not laughing anymore. Richard Leong emailed with this comment:  Arsenal fan from Vancouver, Canada, now living in Brunei...what an amazing season for the Foxes. Gripping drama this season! A story for the ages. And Nelson Zacharia, who didn’t give his location, simply said:  The king of the year no one like this :::::yeah I’m very surprised Updated
 BreatheSport points out a curious synchronicity in the careers of Leicester City keeper Kasper Schmeichel and his father, Peter, the great Manchester United goalie. May 2nd 1993: Peter Schmeichel wins 1st PL title aged 29May 2nd 2016: Kasper Schmeichel wins 1st PL title aged 29 pic.twitter.com/AzgFQzCNnL Of course, Peter went on to win a string of other titles with Utd, including the treble in 1999. Will his son go on to have such a glittering career?  
 Despite the gravitas of yesterday’s Spurs-Chelsea clash, and its implications for Leicester, Claudio Ranieri had chilled day. He told Sky News:  I had lunch with my mother and at 8 o’clock I watched the match Asked what the first title means to him, Ranieri replied:  It means the job is good. I’m very happy now. Maybe if I had won this title at the beginning of my career I would have forgot. But now I am an old man, I can celebrate 
 More Twitter tomfoolery: Two weeks ago Harry Kane, striker for Premiership runners-up Spurs, posted a picture of a pride of lions, apparently suggesting they would hunt down the Foxes and snatch the title from them. Then, on Monday night, Tottenham threw away a two-goal lead against Chelsea, sealing Leicester’s spot at the top of the table. Foxes striker Jamie Vardy replied thus: .... pic.twitter.com/nnwmRyOg6y Pride comes before a fall... Here’s a tweet by Guardian sport editor James Dart, showing the two posts side-by-side:  🦁🦁🦁 pic.twitter.com/5Ddv04srwN 
 Claudio Ranieri’s triumph at Leicester has some of his early critics now doing a quick reverse-ferret.  At the time of Ranieri’s appointment, the former England star turned football pundit and Walker’s Crisps man Gary Lineker tweeted: “Claudio Ranieri? Really?” Now, he claims that tweet slipped out before he had a chance to finish... 
 Matthew Weaver Here is a bit more cribbed from Radio 4’s coverage this morning by Matt Weaver: Sir Dave Brailsford, the former performance director of British Cycling, said Leicester’s success is a “fantastic case study in sport” that all sports teams can learn from.He told BBC Radio 4’s Today programme that British Cycling has been trying to analyse how it can follow Leicester’s example as it prepares for the Olympic games.  “Our sports science guys were up here a month and a half ago meeting with the guys here and having a look at what’s going on - that’s sport we all trying and learn from each other,” he said. Brailsford added: “The refreshing thing about this particularly story is that it just goes against every thing – the established norms and the conventional wisdom about how to win the premier league. It just shatters everything that everybody has established. So it just an exciting opportunity to learn.  “There’s an old saying in sport that the star team will always beat the team of stars. You quite often hear people saying that, and it’s very rarely seen in fact, but this is a really good example of that.’ “They obviously had the talent, but the recruitment of that talent, how did they identify that talent, how did they pull it together, how did they developed goal clarity. The journey they went through was exciting, they built momentum, Vardy’s run of scoring goals, that gave them belief and you could see the belief growing all the time. So it is just a fantastic case study in sport.” 
 My sports desk colleague Stuart James has written the inside story of Leicester’s improbable season, including details of Claudio Ranieri’s appointment, the club’s unorthodox training and injury-recovery regimens, and the tricks that brought them the Premier League title. Here’s a taster: In July last year Claudio Ranieri was enjoying a break in Italy when he received a phone call from Steve Kutner, his agent, that would end up changing the face of English football in a way no one could have imagined. Kutner had been attempting to convince Jon Rudkin, Leicester City’s director of football, that Ranieri was worth considering as the Premier League club’s new manager and finally there was news of a breakthrough. Ranieri was out of work at the time but keen to return to management, in particular in England, where he had fond memories from his time in charge of Chelsea and still owned a property in London going back to those days at Stamford Bridge more than a decade earlier. Several Championship clubs had been sounded out without success when Nigel Pearson’s sacking at Leicester presented Kutner and Ranieri with a window of opportunity. Kutner sensed that Leicester were sceptical about Ranieri, yet he refused to be discouraged. He submitted Ranieri’s CV, listing the distinguished clubs the 64-year-old had managed, together with his record – a Copa del Rey and Super Cup winner with Valencia, Coppa Italia winner at Fiorentina, plus second-place finishes in the Premier League, Ligue 1 and twice in Serie A – and kept chipping away. “I just wanted to get Claudio in front of them, because I was sure that they would be impressed,” Kutner says. 
 Matthew Weaver Peter Soulsby, the directly elected Mayor of Leicester, said the team’s success was a bigger boost to the city than reburial of Richard III. Speaking on BBC Radio 4’s Today programme he said:  Barely 12 months ago we were reburying Richard III in our cathedral and we thought it couldn’t get any better we had the eyes of the world on us at that time. And that has made a major boost to the economy - they reckon many tens of millions of pounds have come in on the back of that. We didn’t think it could get any better, well it has, the premier league is even bigger than that... It has been said that we are somehow being repaid for having reburied King Richard with dignity and honour in our cathedral. I suspect the reality is that it is down to a brilliant team and amazing leadership from two managers - Nigel Pearson and now Claudio Ranieri. Soulsby also portrayed Leicester’s success as a victory for multiculturalism.  It is probably the most diverse city anywhere in Europe and many people in Leicester see the team as a metaphor for the city, showing what you can achieve when you bring together a very diverse group of people who others have written off.

 More details are emerging of the Leicester squad’s big party last night. It looks like it was a good one. Here’s Wes Morgan, Leicester’s captain, who is so delighted he has had to have a lie down.

 Explaining the gravity of Leicester City’s win to those ignorant of football needs some creative thinking. Siddarth Upasani, of India, was on the phone to a London-based friend last night when he came up with a world-class comparison outlining just how unlikely it was. He told me in an email:  I was on the phone last night, talking to a friend studying in London, while watching Chelsea-Spurs. She isn’t interested in football amazingly. Anyway, once Hazard scored, I interrupted her rather rudely and said: ‘Listen, you need make sure you keep this in mind for tomorrow so that you don’t feel left out. Leicester City, a football club, have won the Premier League.’ She asked if this was big news. Exasperated, I explained as follows: ‘Imagine Afghanistan winning the Cricket World Cup. And we are still nowhere near describing Leicester’s victory.’ 
 How do you party when you’ve just won the Premier League? Becky Vardy, wife of Foxes striker Jamie Vardy, has given us a bit of insight with this Instagram snippet of the celebrations in Leicester last night. 
 Leicester City’s Thai owners are hoping to resist attempts by bigger teams to pick off the cream of their league-winning squad, according to AP. Big-money suitors are expected to come calling for star players including midfielders Riyad Mahrez and N’Golo Kante, striker Jamie Vardy and goalkeeper Kasper Schmeichel. But, speaking on Thai television, Aiyawatt Srivaddhanaprabha, son of club chairman Vichai Srivaddhanaprabha, said:  We are not a team who produces players to be developed later by other teams. All players want to stay and keep on fighting together to see how far they can go. So selling players is not on our agenda. Aiyawatt said that when his father bought the Foxes, winning the league “was not what we dared to dream”. He went on: He was already proud of being the owner of an English Premier League team. Now he has owned an English Premier League Champion team, he can’t be prouder. I have to say on his behalf that he has managed the club with his heart and he just hopes to gain a reputation for the country. The owners are already planning a visit to Thailand, even though a a similar visit last year resulted in some youth team players involved in a scandal which contributed to the firing of manager Nigel Pearson. Aiyawatt said:  They are coming to Thailand very, very soon. This is unbelievable. Thai people should be given a lot of credit as all players acknowledge how much support they have been given.

 Leicester City are minnows in the Premier League, but they still have fans all over the world. The Indo Foxes are the LCFC’s Indonesian supporters club, and they are delighted that their team has finally lifted the trophy. In an email, they write:  This Incredible great, we can not express in words. Leicester is the greatest underdog I’ve ever seen during our life. We enjoyed every match and our dreams will come true. Unbelievable 
 Good morning! Damien Gayle here picking up the live blog reins.  As football fans and family around the world celebrate the unlikely Premiership win by Leicester City, it seems that some can’t resist a bit of schadenfreude: Chelsea goalkeeper Asmir Begovic has told BBC Radio London that he's happy to have ruined Tottenham's chances of winning the Premier League. 
 Claire Phipps I’m passing over the live blog, seamlessly, to my colleague Damien Gayle in London. It’s been a pleasure steering you through from Sydney; thanks again for all your messages. Oh, and in summary: Leicester City have won the Premier League title. Bye for now. 
 The emails from happy-crying readers keep coming and before I hand over to a London colleague, there’s time for another best-of round-up. (Thanks to all of those who’ve contacted me, it’s been a joy reading your messages. Sorry I couldn’t feature them all.) Pater Edmund Waldstein messages to say: I’m a Cistercian monk in Austria, and a Liverpool fan, but I am so pleased about Leicester. I’ve even written a blogpost about it. Now, I don’t write football live blogs very often, but I’m going to stick my neck out and say a contribution from a Cistercian monk is a first. Welcome! Gaurav Pandit emails: Congratulations to Leicester City from someone born in India, living in the US and vacationing in Mauritius, and is a Chelsea fan. Not that Chelsea should get any credit for their great achievement, but I am glad we did our bit. It feels great to hand over the trophy to City - there is no shame in it. Given how Chelsea season unfolded, this is the best outcome we could hope for. A fairytale to remember for years! Tom McMahon drops into my inbox from Pinawa, Manitoba, Canada: Every true sports fan in the world must have been cheering for “Lester” and Vardy and “soccer”! We love sports because we believe miracles do happen! Today, Leicester is king of the world! And Deepak Nandhakumar adds: 12 noon here in Kerala, India. Have just woken up after watching the match till 2am (its all right, I’m on study leave!). Just sitting here reading all about Leicester with a big, stupid smile on my face. Lifelong Man U fan but have been rooting for the Foxes from the start of the season. Finally found my 2nd team (Soon to be first if Man U continue the decline). Wanted to write loads more about the incredible stories surrounding this season, but I’m ending it with this: Well done, the Foxes. Champions League awaits … Updated
 Because today is going to echo to the sound of people saying “dilly ding, dilly dong”, you might as well find out what it means: 
 Aha, here’s that Richard III Leicester tribute from the front of Tuesday’s Guardian print edition. A snippet here but click below for the full experience: Since Leicester was my final resting place, Following my reverse at Bosworth Field, The Foxes have became my second love, A steady passion for my vulpine ways. And after last year’s fight with relegation How sweet the plaudits of a smitten nation. 
 A mood-lifting round-up here from my global colleagues featuring some of the stories from this blog as Leicester’s win reverberated from Dunedin to Dhaka, from China to Canada:  As daylight moves west, the world has woken up to a miracle in the British Midlands, gradually celebrated across the Earth by millions who love English football. Or indeed any football. Read it all here:

 Readers, with these emails you are spoiling me. Here’s some more of your messages. Saurya Sengupta writes from Kolkata, India: Leicester’s win has pretty much all of us here who’ve ever watched a game of football in bawling like babies. My girlfriend who doesn’t follow football made it a point to keep track of their matches and hope and pray that they’d win. I don’t think India’s ever come together in such alliance for any football team (since our national team does nothing) – and that’s A LOT of support. This win is definitely one for Ranieri, the perennial nice guy of management … But, it’s also a message to journalists across the world (looking at you, Guardian :P) to stop trying to predict outcomes in football, especially in leagues. It isn’t even as if Leicester were an exception. Spurs were given no shouts of finishing in the top four, very few thought Newcastle would be battling against the drop, and the less said about Chelsea, the better. Point taken. Basnet Govinda, who runs the Leicester City Nepal fans Facebook page, has been in touch to say: I’m being a great fan of Leicester City football club … So I can proudly said that the offiical fan club from Nepal was managed by me … hurrayyy.” Robben, also in Nepal, has dropped me a line too: As a lifelong Chelsea fan from Nepal, with the earthquake and the poor season I had to endure, today’s fight by our team to hand Leicester the title was simply glorious. Tears rolling down with every story people are sharing on your feed! And John Palethorpe messages from New Zealand: Blimey! Kids at the school I teach at in Auckland have slowly been learning about Leicester this season – we’ve gone from them pretending to be Rooney and Hazard to Jamie Vardy and Mahrez. Not seen a shirt yet, but it’s only a matter of time … I saw Wes Morgan play for Forest against Northampton in League One 10 years ago – if you’d told me then that he’d captain a Prem winning side, I’d have laughed. I’m still laughing now though. What a story. Nice one Claudio. 
 Courtesy of Press Association, here are the Leicester boss’s most … characterful quotes of the season. Somebody get this man on Twitter, sharpish. I told them, if you keep a clean sheet, I’ll buy pizza for everybody. I think they’re waiting for me to offer a hot dog too. On being told a Leicester butcher had created a sausage in his honour: I pay for pizza, you pay for the sausage. I am the sausageman. On his distinctive catchphrase: From the beginning when something was wrong I’ve been saying: ‘Dilly-ding, dilly-dong, wake up, wake up!’ So on Christmas day I bought for all the players and all the staff a little bell. It was just a joke. On Jamie Vardy: This is not a footballer. This is a fantastic horse. On LCFC and Tom Hanks: Why can’t we continue to run, run, run? We are like Forrest Gump. Leicester is Forrest Gump. I give you the headline there.”  On Leicester’s run for the title: Now we go straight away to try to win the title. We are in the Champions League, dilly ding, dilly dong – come on. We are in the Champions League, it is fantastic, terrific. Well done to everybody. Updated

 Christy Yao in our Beijing bureau has been talking to one of China’s biggest Leicester fans. Wang Song Ao Han, a 26-year-old from Inner Mongolia, became a Foxes fan back in 2014 when he was studying at the University of Leicester for a master’s degree in media and advertising. Wang was a regular at the King Power stadium and said Monday night’s victory had left him on the verge of tears. “I have no words to express how I am feeling. It’s probably one of the best feelings I have ever felt in my entire life,” said Wang who lives in Beijing but is originally from Tongliao, a city of about three million inhabitants towards China’s border with Mongolia and Russia. “I watched Leicester when they were virtually unheard of. Hardly any Chinese journalists knew about them. Even in UK, it isn’t a well-known city. It’s a very small,” Wang went on. “It is really hard to express the feeling of seeing a team go from being a complete nobody to being today’s Premier League champion.” Wang said he would organise a celebratory dinner in Beijing on Saturday night to watch Leicester’s last home game of the season, against Everton. “I am so excited. I hope the dream will last a long time. I can’t get enough of it,” he said.  
 I suspect that readers are now engaged in some concerted effort to get a name-check for every country in the globe on this blog. Undaunted by the strength of the Australian and Canadian contingents, you’ve sent messages from far and wide. From Honduras, Dominic Fleming writes: As an Everton fan since I was seven years old I’m so relieved I will be able to follow my team with no guilt next weekend. Watched the Tottenham game in Utila, Honduras, today and the place erupted when Hazard grabbed the equaliser. The mosquitos are being ignored as we currently toast the upset of all upsets. Ben Daggers emails from Japan: The Osaka branch of the Leicester City fan club (population: 3) had a delirious Monday night. With a 4am kickoff there were no bars showing the game – we had to settle for a flurry of mildly-panicked, expletive-filled first half of text messages, followed by a euphoric, expletive-filled second half … Finally got to sleep at 7am and will be spending today smiling. And from Iran, Hugo Corden-Lloyd sends this: Just woken up in Tehran to see that Leicester are the champions! Everywhere I’ve been in the city over the last month as soon as I tell people I’m English the response has been ‘Jamie Vardy, Khoob!’ Which means Jamie Vardie, good! Some things just seem to generate universal excitement, which is a great thing to see. Ruby Dean has had a late night/early start in Nigeria: Words can’t describe how ecstatic I am by 4am in the wee hours of the morning in Nigeria! … Hard work surely begets success! Congrats to the new kings! And Mark Hannant seems to be having a tough night in Saudi Arabia but we’re here to help: My wife and I and two small children are stuck in Jeddah airport for 12 hours en route from Mumbai to Manchester. ‘Happy Hammer’ all my life so fully understand the disappointments of supporting unfashionable clubs. The Guardian’s rolling coverage is making a rather grim night into something memorable. Thanks. 
 If you’re just joining us/waking up/hearing the word Leicester for the first time, welcome! And also, what kept you? Here’s a great explainer of why everyone is very excited about a team that many expected to be facing relegation but that is instead getting its hands on the Premier League trophy: Updated
 My colleague Oliver Holmes in Bangkok has been checking out Leicester City’s Thai Facebook page, where many are hoping the team’s success could be translated to Thai football. “Goosebumps! Cheering on Leicester City is like cheering on the Thai national team. Foreigners say it’s a Thai team – not Mr Vichai’s team,” writes user Imnanmanas. “Congrats from my heart … even though I’m a Liverpool fan … because you are team of Thais,” writes user Gaoten, who wears a Liverpool shirt in his Facebook profile. “This has created the new page of history in the world of football around the world that you don’t have to invest mega amounts of money by buying expensive players to be champions. It’s about thinking and the management within the club. Absolutely the best! I would love to see Thai players get experience and prove their place with Leicester City,” writes user Winyool Yasrakool.

 I have had lots of emails from readers in Canada, which is always a joy whatever the reason, but right now makes me wonder if there is a great undiscovered Leicester diaspora there. Francesco emails to say: I am a life-long Arsenal supporter (now living in Canada having left my home in Ireland a few years ago). I have to say I am delighted with Leicester winning the title. I was always very impressed with the way Ranieri conducted himself at all the clubs he managed and he deserves all the praise he is receiving at the moment … Many years ago he saved Parma football club (Parma is the place where I was born) from certain relegation when he took over the team mid-season, an incredible feat at the time. His tactical acumen came in very handy towards the end of the season when the team needed points desperately. Christine Welch is one of a number of readers who’ve contacted me today to say their fathers would have been celebrating the victory: WOW. This makes me feel so good. My Dad used to take me to Filbert Street in the early 50s, he was a number one fan, no way could they do any wrong, he always blamed the ref. After every season he would always say ONE DAY WE WILL. He used to drive me crazy but he never wavered, he would have loved this day. Gavin Wightman checks in from Belle River, Ontario: I have been a Leicester fan for over 30 years especially since my Dad used to take me to games as a teenager. Moved here in 2008 and haven’t seen another Leicester fan. My nine-year-old son wears his Leicester shirt to school with pride, with the other kids in ignorance in their Barcelona/Messi shirts – perhaps now they will realise the significance. What an awesome achievement! (Gavin, as you can see, you are definitely not Canada’s sole Leicester fan!) Nick Grayson, also from Ontario, shares this tale: My father was born in Leicester on Brandon Street in 1929, we emigrated to Canada in 1973 when I was 13 … He hated football though and thought it was a total waste of time, (at least that’ s what he told me). Of course I loved the game and can still name all of the player’s from Leicester’s FA Cup team … He died just shortly after they found King Richard’s body. On his own death bed we talked about everything Leicester, even down to the parking lot where they found him … His final comments went to football, something he never brought up first. He asked me how Leicester were doing and that he had seen them play many times as child. I wasn’t expecting this confession and that’s where his life ended, with him saying that King Richard might bring the city luck. I never thought of my dad as a prophet – smart, but not a prophet. Tonight though my dad, King Richard and Leicester are bending their elbows and toasting those who believe and the underdogs, the strength of teamwork over straight-up dollars and buying success. I love it and long may they run. I’m hoping Nick’s dad would have appreciated Tuesday’s Guardian print front page: Tomorrow's Guardian front page in print #Leicester pic.twitter.com/4jhFPcoWT9 Updated
 It’s nearly dawn in Leicester and I strongly suspect some fans will be up to see the sun rise. Obviously all workplaces and schools in Leicester are giving everyone the day off on Tuesday*. (*You might need to check this because I have just made it up and I’m not the mayor or anything like that.) 
 Maybe it’s the Schwarzer effect, but I’m hearing from plenty of Leicester fans in Australia today. Here are a couple: Jo Staniforth emails to say: I got up at 4am to watch the Chelsea game in Adelaide … I just can’t get my head around anything else at the moment. I rang my brother in the UK at the final whistle and all we could manage was ‘fucking hell!’ Kevin Wesson had a good start to the day too: In almost 40 years of following Leicester City, I have never even day-dreamed of this. Sure I have imagined us winning the FA Cup on a sunny day in May or even European success on a balmy night in foreign climes, but never the Premier League! Got up this morning just in time to see Eden Hazard score Chelsea’s second and decisive goal. My seven-year-old son insisted on calling Grandma in the UK to share (who lives in the same town as Jamie Vardy) to share the wonderful news! Although he couldn’t wear his Leicester kit to school I borrowed his scarf to fly from my car window on this morning commute. Just finalising the post Mother’s Day pass-out to be in the UK for the final game at Chelsea and the open-top bus parade! Updated
 Will the Leicester City and Australia goalkeeper end his season with a winner’s medal? Leicester’s victory has lent some weight to the theory that Mark Schwarzer is a Premier League lucky charm. While the former Socceroo did not play a single league match for the Foxes this season, he became the first goalkeeper to be involved in back-to-back title victories with separate clubs. Schwarzer, who was with Chelsea last season, does not meet the official criteria to qualify for a winner’s medal, which stipulate a player must have made at least five appearances to receive one. The veteran did not play a league match during Chelsea’s title run last year either, yet he still pocketed a medal after then-Blues manager Jose Mourinho decided to buy him a replica in recognition of his efforts from the bench. There has been no indication yet from the victorious Leicester camp as to whether Claudio Ranieri will follow suit this year and make Schwarzer the first player since Eric Cantona (Leeds United-Manchester United in 1992 and 1993) to win back-to-back top-flight titles with different clubs.

 Reader Andrew Marshall emails to suggest that my esteemed Guardian football colleague Daniel Taylor deserves to lose extra points for his “Most excited about” prediction (made in August 2015). What do we think? Most excited about: I Believe in Miracles, the Jonny Owen documentary-film about Nottingham Forest, 1975-80, and the kind of implausible success story that could never happen again. In case anyone thinks I am enjoying this period of gloating at my colleagues: a) yes, yes I am, rather; and b) I’d never have predicted a Leicester City win either, so I am an enormous hypocrite. 
 Tom Phillips Even in China football fans are celebrating Leicester’s victory, which a report by state broadcaster CCTV described as being less likely than finding the Loch Ness monster or discovering that Elvis was alive. One message left on the club’s official Weibo account this morning reads: “I am so happy to witness Leicester’s fairy tale! Thanks Leicester City for showing me how charming football can be again! It is so great for people who have dreams!” "The cheering was loud enough to wake even King Richard III!" - China's official news agency on @LCFC triumph https://t.co/cShAYq3J4e 
 I’m sure my UK sports colleagues will take this in the spirit it’s intended (mild-ribbing-verging-on-outright-mockery), but given it’s 4.15am there and they’ll be asleep, let’s go for it. Here are their predictions for the 2016 EPL, made at the start of the season: I count 10 votes in there for Leicester to be among the teams relegated. Zero for title winners. And a couple of comments that I’m sure their originators have already eaten with a side helping of humble pie: Relegated: Watford and Norwich, just because they go up and they go down. And probably Leicester too. No Nigel, no party.  How Claudio Ranieri continues to land good jobs is a mystery. Relegated: Leicester, Sunderland and Norwich. I fear that Claudio Ranieri will struggle at Leicester.  Relegated: Watford, Leicester and Newcastle all for the same reason: the manager.  I’m going to give Louise Taylor a bonus point for caveating her expectation that Leicester would find themselves in the relegation zone:  … but Claudio Ranieri may just exceed expectations. Still, wouldn’t it be boring if football followed all the predictions? And most of them were backing Leicester by February: 
 More reader emails! This is the best bit of my job today, I’ll be honest. Rob Newton messages to say: Two weeks ago I was in Hsi Paw, a small town in Shan state, Myanmar. Hsi Paw is mostly notable for its tea, its trekking, and the occasional flare-up of the decades-old conflict between Shan rebels and the Myanmar army. I walked into a pancake shop, where they were playing the premier league. The owner asked where I was from. I said Leicestershire. And he proudly declared his allegiance to Leicester City. Free pancakes in Hsi Paw tonight! Chilima Chola says hi from Lusaka, Zambia: Leicester’s story is our story. Everyday we get beaten down and slammed to the ground by life and our realities. But today, Leicester showed me and Zambia that no matter what the odds are in life, hard work and persistence is all you need to succeed in life. Joe Nhodza, from Zimbabwe, is warming to the fairytale theme: I’m a Man U fan but for some reason I’m up at 4.30am in this part of the world called Zimbabwe. And I’m finding it rather impossible not to be happy for Leicester. I feel Leicester’s story proves just how much everyone loves a good fairytale ending. I could compare Leicester’s triumph to that moment when Anna managed to thaw queen Elsa’s frozen heart, by getting her to believe in love again: marvellous! Well done Leicester for being our modern-day fairytale. Guru Singh is setting Leicester’s sights even higher: I am at the moment in Boston, USA. As a lifelong Nottingham Forest fan I can applause Leicester’s fantastic achievement having lived through similar emotions many times with Forest. Well done The Foxes! Now go and win the European Cup! 
 It’s a happy morning in Bangkok, Oliver Holmes reports: The Spurs match was at 2am, so only the most dedicated fans in Thailand watched, but many are waking up to the news now. Many supporters here were hoping that Leicester would win it at the weekend in the game against Manchester United, which was at 8pm. I was at King Power HQ, a huge duty-free outlet in central Bangkok, that night speaking to fans about why they loved Leicester. The club’s owner, billionaire Vichai Srivaddhanaprabha, had treated hundreds to free beer, fresh prawns and a huge screen under the palm trees. One fan, Akapong Nutthawute, said he had won a competition on Leicester City’s Thai Facebook page to get a seat at the showing. He has been watching English football since his childhood, mainly because that was the only choice. “Twenty or 30 years ago the only league that we could watch in Thailand was British. The other leagues weren’t on television, so Thais support British teams,” said the 37-year-old engineer from the country’s north. He said that he still has love for Liverpool, the team his parents have supported for decades, saying that Leicester was an “alternate team”. “This team have the team work. They played together last year and each player knows the skills of the other,” he said. His friend, the other lucky draw winner, nodded his head in approval. 
 The second biggest question of the day (after Where is Claudio Ranieri?) is – for those newer to LCFC’s meteoric rise – the challenge of pronouncing Leicester. Google’s suggested search reveals that it has certainly had a few queries (seriously, though, who doesn’t know how to pronounce “Lego”?): US broadcaster NBC came prepared: a napkin made by US television network (and EPL broadcast rights-holder) NBC two years ago https://t.co/nTgaQ40MOE pic.twitter.com/fVB6QU9uYK 
 Oliver Holmes reports from Bangkok that many supporters on Leicester City’s Thai Facebook page, which has nearly 600,000 members, are sharing photos of themselves holding up talismanic cloths, which are blessed by Buddhist monks. Also doing the rounds is a photoshopped image of Claudio Ranieri with Buddhist tattoos on his chest. The text of the tattoos reads: “Brave and unyielding over any team. If you have this, your fortune will send you to be champions.” Updated
 More emails from fans all over the globe, and this first one, from Riley Strother, might win today’s prize for the most farflung location: I’m alone at the Race Rocks lighthouse, which is situated on a tiny island on the west coast of British Columbia, Canada, and I am ecstatic about Leicester becoming champions! I’m a Newcastle fan, but since the start of the season I have been pulling for Leicester to pull off this incredible upset, and for the last few months I’ve been following every game out here on this rock. Even though there are only seals and sea lions to confirm it, I am indeed dancing for joy! Riley, please ask a marine mammal to take a photo to verify your claim. Diego García pops up with a message: Writing from the Dominican Republic just to let you know Leicester’s story and success were followed and celebrated here too. This is what makes sports so beautiful. Sveinn Sigþórsson says hello from Iceland: Earlier this evening I was at a game between KR Reykjavik and Vikingur Reykjavik in the Icelandic Premier League. The stadium announcer usually announces other goals around the Icelandic league and then the MOTM, but I’ve never heard him comment on matches abroad. Tonight, he excitedly announced “Chelsea and Tottenham have drawn 2-2, Leicester are champions!”, which drew wild celebrations from the crowd all around the stadium. As the match finished with a 0-0 scoreline that was just as boring as it sounds, this provided the only excitement of the game. And a magnanimous email from Jarrod Wilkinson-Smith, self-styled “Spurs fan in NZ”: So happy for Leicester – the table doesn’t lie. Also really happy Spurs are going to Champs League again – if we get one more star player and don’t lose the main guys we will be a real force for the next decade. Thanks to all of you who are emailing me. I’m reading them all and will feature as many of them as I can on here. 
 Eleanor Ainge Roy sends this jolly dispatch from New Zealand: At the bottom of the world, in Dunedin, Hayley Stirling spent Tuesday morning glued to her phone. Her internet was out, but her friend Maria in Yorkshire texted her minute-by-minute updates of the match, and she was “on tenterhooks” waiting to hear if Leicester City would prevail. [3/5 8:09 AM] Hayley: Fuck it, spurs are up by 2... damn. [3/5 8:11 AM] Maria: I know!!! I’m fuming. Chelsea better score 2 and quick! [3/5 8:18 AM] Maria: 2-1!!! Game on! [3/5 8:21 AM] Hayley: Woop woop, come on gus this is the one time im rooting for you! [3/5 8:22 AM] Maria: Same here!! Come on Chelsea [3/5 8:43 AM] Maria: 2-2!!! 7 minutes to go!! A draw is all they need!!! Come on!! [3/5 8:56 AM] Maria: Yes Leicester!!!! Amazing! [3/5 9:04 AM] Hayley: Oh my god!!!!!!!! Waaaaahhhhhoooooooo!!!! Foxes foxes foxes foxes!!!! Ranieri for president! [3/5 9:12 AM] Maria: Haha I’d vote Ranieri for President. “When I got into work, we didn’t say anything at all, we all just started high-fiving and hugging each other,” said Stirling, who is the women’s football development officer for Football South. “Usually we’ve all supported the big teams, but this season all of us have gone for Leicester. I think it’s a timeless thing anyone can relate to – we all want the underdog to have a chance for success, in sport and life.” Today Stirling and her colleagues have been too excited to concentrate on work, and have instead spent hours outside in the autumn sunshine, kicking a football back and forth “pretending we’re Jamie Vardy”. “We’ll go out tonight for a couple of drinks. We all can’t stop smiling. It’s really a great day here.” Updated
 People “take to Twitter” for anything these days, I know, but UK football fans really did hit those 140 characters last night: Wow.Leicester winning the league triggered an 86% increase in normal Twitter activity in the UK...#havingaparty pic.twitter.com/vGTmtqwq2E Here’s the Twitter moment – you know, that bit at the bottom of the app that you never click on – on Leicester’s victory:
