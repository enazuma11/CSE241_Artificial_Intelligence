 John McEnroe, Boris Becker and Martina Navratilova yesterday handed in a letter signed by 33 former players to the International Tennis Federation calling for major changes in racket technology. The letter describes the modern game as "unbalanced and one-dimensional" and calls for changes to help bring back more serve-volleyers.  The letter to the ITF president Francesco Ricci Bitti claims that few matches these days involve players of contrasting styles. Instead there is "a preponderance of baseliners using Western grip fore hands, most of them with two-handed backhands, and hitting with fierce topspin".  Modern racket technology, which has developed powerful, light, wide-bodied rackets, is seen as the chief culprit. The letter suggests that the ITF consider reducing the width of the head of tennis rackets from the present limit of 12.5in to 9in, perhaps in stages over four or five years.  However, the campaign may be weakened by the lack of current players among the signatories. Andy Roddick said yesterday: "No disrespect but I don't know if the ITF is going to take too seriously a letter from past players."
