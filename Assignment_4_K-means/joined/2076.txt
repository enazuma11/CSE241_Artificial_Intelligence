 Rafael Nadal made a losing start to his Masters Cup challenge against James Blake after being put on hold, not for the first time, by Roger Federer. The Spaniard's match was delayed for 25 minutes while the Swiss was presented with a trophy for finishing world No1 a third time, whereupon the world No2 Nadal lost 6-4, 7-6 to Blake despite leading 4-0 in the second set, holding a point for 5-1 and serving for the set at 5-4. While there were flashes of brilliance from the American, Nadal's three weeks off showed. "The problem is not my tennis, it is a little bit of confidence," he said. "One win and all will change." One more loss here, though, and his season will be over.
