 The fourth studio album from Virginia’s Sons of Bill – so-called because three of them are the sons of a man named Bill, with no concession to mystery whatsoever – is one of those delightful surprises that music so rarely springs in the age of digital access and constant, instant discovery. Their previous albums made so little impression that I’d never even heard of them, but Love and Logic is enough to make lovers of Americana-tinged rock purr. There’s nothing even remotely original here: you can hear early REM, especially in Landslide and the gently rocking Big Unknown, with the kind of vocal harmonies Mike Mills used to specialise in, and plenty of Son Volt – albeit a rather less grouchy Son Volt – in the country-rock twang of Road to Canaan and Fishing Song. Lost in the Cosmos (Song for Chris Bell) wouldn’t disgrace the former Big Star leader himself, as yearning as it is subdued. It’s lovely stuff – the kind of music that makes you yearn for some imagined deep south that never existed.
