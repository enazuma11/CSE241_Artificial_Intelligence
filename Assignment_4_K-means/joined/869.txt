 Kyle Edmund has secured a place in the main draw of the Australian Open following Richard Gasquet’s withdrawal. When the entry lists were released earlier this month, the British No3 was three spots outside automatic qualification but the world No9, Gasquet, who is suffering with a back injury, has joined Juan Mónaco and the Australian youngster Thanasi Kokkinakis in pulling out of the year’s first grand slam, which begins on 18 January. At 102 in the rankings, Edmund thought he had done enough anyway but initially missed out owing to five players using protected rankings. The 20-year-old came through qualifying in Melbourne last year before losing in the first round to the American Steve Johnson, but gaining direct entry is a major bonus. Edmund must have been confident he would make it because he had already signed up for the exhibition event at Kooyong, which is played at the same time as qualifying. Edmund’s inclusion in the field shows his growing reputation, which was enhanced when he made his Davis Cup debut for Great Britain in the final against Belgium last month. The world No16, David Goffin, eventually recovered from two sets down to beat him but was given a big scare by the powerful Yorkshireman.
