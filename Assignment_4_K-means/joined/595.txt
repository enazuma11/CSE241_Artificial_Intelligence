Party’s ‘Brexit bottom line’ includes continued access to single market, and a guarantee on workplace rights Staff and agencies 
 Labour will only let Theresa May trigger the process for leaving the European Union if she agrees to the party’s “Brexit bottom line”, Jeremy Corbyn has said in an interview.  The opposition will join forces with Conservative remain supporters and other parties to block article 50 if the prime minister does not guarantee access to the single market, the Labour leader told the Sunday Mirror.  The paper said that Corbyn’s four bottom lines were: Corbyn suggested that May, who has a slim Commons majority, would be forced into an early election if she failed to meet Labour demands, according to the newspaper.  The government is appealing against a high court ruling ordering that the PM must seek MPs’ approval to trigger article 50.  Corbyn told the Sunday Mirror: “The court has thrown a big spanner in the works by saying parliament must be consulted. We accept the result of the referendum.  “We are not challenging the referendum. We are not calling for a second referendum. We’re calling for market access for British industry to Europe.” The Labour leader dodged calls earlier over whether he would be happy if there was an early election but told the newspaper the party was “ready for it”.  “We have the members, the organisation and the enthusiasm. We welcome the challenge,” he said.  “It would give us the chance to put before the British people an alternative economic strategy for this country.”  It comes after the May was urged to calm the backlash sparked by the controversial high court ruling on the process for leaving the European Union.
