 Martin van Jaarsveld said he felt "humbled" after becoming the first Kent player to score two hundreds and take a five-for in the same game and only the 12th in the history of first-class cricket. Van Jaarsveld, 70 overnight, added an undefeated 115 today to his first-innings 114 not out as Kent made surprisingly light work of chasing down 258 on a wearing pitch, and later described his overall contribution as the stuff of his "wildest dreams". Not since the West Indian all-rounder Franklyn Stephenson performed the feat 20 years ago for Nottinghamshire against Yorkshire has one individual loomed so statistically large over a game of cricket in this country, and there was almost a sense of destiny about the way he picked off the runs after Kent began the day needing a further 92 to win with five wickets in hand. Otherwise impeccable, Van Jaarsveld survived a tough chance to short leg off Saqlain Mushtaq in the fifth over, but by the time Geraint Jones edged Jade Dernbach to first slip to depart for 39, Kent needed just 30 more. Moments later Surrey heads dropped for good when Abdul Razzaq failed to hold on to the catchable chance offered by Yasir Arafat at mid-off. They remain winless, as well as bottom of Division One, and their coach, Alan Butcher, bemoaned their collapse from 50 without loss to 130 all out in the third innings. "We spoke before about that innings and we knew we could either set the game up or cock it up," he said. "I don't think we've batted well for a couple of years now as a side."  Butcher denied that Mark Ramprakash's ongoing pursuit of his 100th hundred was becoming an issue in the dressing room, but added: "If your top player is short of runs, it's going to affect any side."
