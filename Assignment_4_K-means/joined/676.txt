 Roger Federer has announced that he will team up with the Spanish coach Jose Higueras at this week's Estoril Open. The decision comes after an uncharacteristically poor start to the season by Federer, who has yet to win a tournament this year after struggling with indifferent form and a bout of glandular fever. Higueras' presence alongside Federer in Portugal will mark the first time that the Swiss world No1 has had a coach in his corner since parting company with Tony Roche last May. "I am excited as I have asked Jose Higueras, one of the most respected and accomplished coaches in the world of tennis, to join me," Federer revealed on his official website. "Jose has coached many of the game's great players including the former world No1 Jim Courier and Michael Chang. We are going to spend the week together to see if we could make a good team." The decision to recruit Higueras, a seasoned dirt-court campaigner who reached the last four at the French Open in 1982 and 1983, is indicative of where Federer's priorities lie heading into the European clay court season. Roland Garros remains the one major title to elude the Swiss, who lies within two grand slam tournament wins of equalling Pete Sampras's all-time record of 14. Federer would dearly love to extend that run in Paris and Higueras, a former world No6 who reached successive French Open semi-finals in 1982 and 1983, boasts an impeccable clay-court pedigree; in Michael Chang, Jim Courier, Carlos Moya, Sergi Bruguera and Jennifer Capriati, the Spaniard has worked with no fewer than five former Roland Garros champions.
