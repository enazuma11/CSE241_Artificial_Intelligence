 The former Manchester United and Sunderland defender Wes Brown has joined Blackburn Rovers until the end of the season, the Championship side have announced. The player, who turns 37 in October, has been training with Blackburn since leaving Sunderland in the summer. A deal had been delayed by a calf injury Brown suffered during pre-season. The former England international will also spend time working with Damien Johnson and David Dunn coaching the club’s under-23s. Owen Coyle, the Blackburn manager, has praised Brown’s attitude during training, saying: “He’s been outstanding. He’s a constant professional – his attitude has been exemplary around the training ground with the young players, helping and encouraging them.”
