 The Australia vice-captain Michael Clarke is unsure whether Brett Lee will be fit enough to resume his one-day career, despite Lee retiring from Test matches to focus on the shorter game. The 33-year-old faces a lengthy rehabilitation following surgery on his elbow in December and described the injury as the "most painful" of a Test career in which he took 310 wickets but struggled with injury. Clarke, speaking before Australia departed for their tour of New Zealand, said: "I think he's still facing a tough challenge to get his elbow right and see if he can come out and go back to bowling how he used to bowl." But Clarke believes that if Lee can get back to full fitness he will remain a valuable part of the Australia side. "His statistics don't lie. In all three forms he's a wonderful player and has been for a long time for Australia, so if he's fully fit I'm sure he'll make his way back into any form of the game." Lee missed last year's Ashes defeat after picking up a side strain in the tour game against England Lions on the eve of the first Test and has not worn the baggy green since the 2008 Boxing Day Test against South Africa. "He's been a wonderful player in all three forms of the game for a long time (and) he's a very good friend of mine and someone that I'll continue enjoying playing international cricket with," Clarke added.
