 The debut album from London three-piece Vaults is practically guaranteed success, given the inclusion of their cover of Randy Crawford’s One Day I’ll Fly Away on this year’s John Lewis Christmas ad. But it will be deserved, as this is an assured collection of commercially astute electronica. Indeed, such is the depth on show here, the single doesn’t even stand out on an album that’s laden with potential hits, from the irresistible, gospel-tinged Midnight River to the seductive melancholia of Bloodflow. And in Blythe Pepino, powerful of voice and refreshingly frank about her polyamorous relationships, they have a singer with genuine star potential.
