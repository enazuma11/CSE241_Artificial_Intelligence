 Like the record executive who turned down the Beatles, there's a marketing executive who worked at RIM (now BlackBerry) who must rue the day he or she ever heard the name "Justin Bieber". According to a comprehensive "oral history of BlackBerry" in the latest issue of Bloomberg BusinessWeek, Bieber approached the company in 2007, offering to become a "brand ambassador". As recounted by Vincent Washington, RIM's senior business development manager from 2001-11, the awful moment came and went quickly. One thing we missed out on was that Justin Bieber wanted to rep BlackBerry. He said, “Give me $200,000 and 20 devices, and I’m your brand ambassador,” basically. And we pitched that to marketing: Here’s a Canadian kid, he grew up here, all the teeny-boppers will love that. They basically threw us out of the room. They said, “This kid is a fad. He’s not going to last.” I said at the meeting: “This kid might outlive RIM.” Everyone laughed. Of course, in 2013 RIM changed its name to BlackBerry. Bieber … is still called Bieber. At the time the company barely advertised because it was certain that its reputation in businesses ensured that people would come to it. The story - which is told through quotations from people who worked with and around the company - shows that the meteoric rise of the company came through the fact that in around 2003, owning one marked you out: "BlackBerry was a darling of enterprise. If you had a BlackBerry you were an important person, as at that time a lot of people didn’t have a smartphone. It was almost a status symbol within the company," the article quotes Kevin Michaluk, founder of CrackBerry.com. " It was the most intuitive communication device. With that blinking red light, it had that addictive quality." It also made the crossover into consumer popularity in 2004, when the company began handing handsets out to Bollywood celebrities, and the 2006 BlackBerry Pearl appeared with a trackwheel and a camera - the latter being an addition that the company had previously eschewed. But the problems began to multiply as the iPhone and then Android phones forced the company to try to catch up. By 2008, recalls Brendan Kenalty, of customer base management, 2007-10: All the market research was saying, “Hey, everybody wants what they call candy bar phones,” which is the nonflip phone. And the next [BlackBerry] product that came down the pipe was the new Pearl Flip. All the sales guys were, like, “What the hell? We asked you for big screens, touchscreens, more of these candy bar styles.” And they were, like, “Yeah, but we came up with this really cool technology about the hinge. Look at how this works!” There’s probably still a warehouse full of them. So RIM, as it was, produced its first "touchscreen" device – the BlackBerry Storm – which garnered terrible reviews, and of which Kunal Gupta, CEO of Polar, which develops applications for companies to publish on mobile platforms, including BlackBerry devices, says in the article: We got an early prototype. When you clicked something, it would take longer than it should. It would crash or freeze. You were used to every BlackBerry product being a winner. This one felt like an afterthought. From there the story is well-known: the failure of the PlayBook tablet, and the same – so far – for the new BB10 platform. But there's still optimism inside the company, according to Jeff Gadway, current senior manager for product marketing: When you go into the focus groups, and you talk to customers about brands in the technology space, there are brands that don’t come up at all anymore. And then there’s BlackBerry. People have fond sentiments about BlackBerry. If people didn’t have that affinity toward the brand, I would be challenged to really believe in what we’re doing. People want to see BlackBerry succeed. Might it all have been different if that marketing executive had seen the potential of Justin Bieber back in 2007, though?
