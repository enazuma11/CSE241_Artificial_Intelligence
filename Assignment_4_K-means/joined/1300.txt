The first feature from Chanya Button sends close friends Seph (Downton Abbey’s Laura Carmichael) and Alex (Chloe Pirrie, best known for Shell) on a road trip with the ashes of their late friend Dan (Jack Farthing). The approach is a blend of comedy of discomfort – a brilliant cameo by Julian Rhind-Tutt is mortifyingly funny – and sober reflection on lives that have reached a turning point. It’s not wholly original, but Burn Burn Burn is nicely acted and emotionally authentic. Button shows real promise as a director.
