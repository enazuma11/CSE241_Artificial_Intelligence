 Tom Carroll has signed a new contract that will keep him at Tottenham Hotspur until 2019. The 24-year-old midfielder, an academy graduate, enjoyed his breakthrough season at Spurs in 2015-16, scoring three goals in 30 appearances. He has played only once this campaign – appearing from the bench late on in Tottenham’s 1-0 home win over Crystal Palace – and he knows he must work hard for a regular place in Mauricio Pochettino’s side. “I’m happy to be rewarded with this new deal and I’ve got to do it all over again now and impress the manager,” Carroll told the Spurs website. “We’ve a top squad here full of international players, so it’s hard. But you have to keep your head down, keep working hard every day and see where it takes you. I know if I get a chance I have to take it.”
