 Raheem Kassam, Nigel Farage’s former chief of staff, has withdrawn from the race to be Ukip leader, leaving just Paul Nuttall and Suzanne Evans in the running.  The rightwing journalist had been the most colourful contender in the field, expressing admiration for the US presidential candidate Donald Trump and gaining the backing of the major Ukip donor Arron Banks.  Despite causing controversy over comments in which he suggested Nicola Sturgeon should tape her legs shut and described Evans as a wrinkly ginger bird, he became the second favourite to win behind Nuttall.  However, he suspended his bid on Monday after holding meetings with supporters over the weekend, saying he had concluded that the “path to victory is too narrow”.  Kassam claimed he was not confident in the integrity of the ballot and criticised his treatment by the media, after a journalist approached his parents at their home.  He also acknowledged he had not raised enough funds to hold meetings around the country to connect with grassroots Ukip members, meaning he would only have been able to run a digital campaign from Westminster.  In a statement on his website, Kassam said: “After much consideration, I have decided not to pursue my campaign to be Ukip leader any further. This was a very difficult decision, and I want to thank everyone who supported me in the process. It is a decision I have not taken lightly.”  Kassam will return to his job as the editor-in-chief of Breitbart London, travelling to the US this week to cover the last leg of the presidential elections. His withdrawal cements the position of Nuttall, the former deputy leader of Ukip, as the favourite to win.
