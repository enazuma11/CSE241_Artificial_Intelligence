 David Cameron has announced he is standing down as MP for Witney, triggering a byelection. It marks the end of the former prime minister’s parliamentary career, Cameron having previously said he intended to carry on as a local MP to 2020 and beyond.

What will he be most remembered for, and what is his chief political legacy? You can share your views by filling out the form below.
