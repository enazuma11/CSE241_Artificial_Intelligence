 World number one Roger Federer faces a tough task in his bid to win the French Open for the first time. The Swiss, dreaming of capturing the only grand slam title to have eluded him, was drawn in the same half as several dangerous opponents, including former champion Juan Carlos Ferrero. He could also run into Tommy Robredo, Marat Safin, Ivan Ljubicic, Nikolay Davydenko, David Nalbandian, Guillermo Canas and Fernando Gonzalez. Twice defending champion Rafael Nadal, the world number two, was handed a far easier draw for the tournament, which starts at Roland Garros this Sunday. Top seed Federer will start with a relatively easy match against little-known American Michael Russell and should not be challenged in the next two rounds. From the fourth round, however, things are likely to get a lot more complicated for him as he could meet Spaniard Ferrero, the 2003 champion. If he survives that, a possible semi-final clash against Gonzalez could be on the cards. Nadal will start against unheralded Argentinian Juan Martin Del Potro and has a smooth passage through to the fourth round, in which he could meet Australian Lleyton Hewitt. Former champion Carlos Moya of Spain and American Andy Roddick, seeded third, could then stand in the 20-year-old's way before a possible semi-final encounter with Serbia's Novak Djokovic, seeded sixth. England's Tim Henman will play Latvia's Ernests Gulbis in the first round. If he wins, and beats 25th seed Robin Soderling or Albert Montanes in the second round, the British number two could then take on reigning two-time champion Rafael Nadal in round three. Gulbis, 18, is a talented right-hander who has shot up the rankings since turning professional in 2005. He ended 2006 ranked 139th position in the world, and is currently 84th in the charts. He has already won challenger events in Besancon and Sarajevo this year. Henman, who has been troubled by knee problems this season, has slipped to 52nd in the world after a poor start to 2007. He has yet to win even a set in his two matches on clay this year. He was dumped out of the Masters event in Monte Carlo in April at the first-round stage by Juan Carlos Ferrero, and suffered the same fate at the hands of Nicolas Almagro in Rome earlier this month. Henman chose not to compete in the recent Masters event in Hamburg in a bid to fine-tune his preparations for Roland Garros. In the women's draw, the top contenders look set to progress smoothly through to the latter stages. World number one Justine Henin, who like Nadal is chasing a third successive crown, starts against Russia's Elena Vesnina, while Maria Sharapova, the second seed but not a clay court specialist, will face French woman Emilie Loit in the first round.
