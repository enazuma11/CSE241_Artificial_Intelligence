 With Nigel Farage resigning as leader of Ukip we’d like to know what the current mood is among its supporters. Speaking at a press conference on Monday, he said he had fulfilled his political ambitions after successfully campaigning for the UK to vote for Brexit and that it was time for him to take a rest. It is the third time he has stepped down as the party leader, but Farage dismissed the idea of coming back again in the future and claimed standing as an MP was no longer top of his to-do list. Speaking at a press conference in Westminster on Monday, he said: “During the referendum I said I wanted my country back … now I want my life back.”  Whether you have been a member of the party for some time or have recently joined, we’d like to hear from you. What are your hopes for Ukip and do you think they can be achieved without Farage? Has your support for the party changed since his resignation? If you’re a Ukip supporter we’d like to hear from you.
