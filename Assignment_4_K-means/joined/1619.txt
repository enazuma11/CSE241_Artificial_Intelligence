 Dimitri Payet’s agent expects the France forward to stay at West Ham despite rumours linking him with a transfer to Real Madrid and Internazionale among others. Payet, who is preparing for France’s Euro 2016 quarter-final against Iceland on Sunday, signed a contract in February worth an estimated £125,000 a week which is due to expire in 2021. He moved to West Ham last summer from Marseille for £10.7m and was nominated for the PFA player of the year ward after scoring nine Premier League goals. Payet has continued that form into Euro 2016, having scored crucial goals in both of France’s opening fixtures against Romania and Albania. His performances led to reports in Spain that Real Madrid could target the 29-year-old this summer, with Paris Saint-Germain and Barcelona also rumoured to be interested. Payet’s long-term adviser, Jacques-Olivier Auguste, told the Guardian it is unlikely his client will be on the move. “He has a great contract with West Ham so I cannot see him leaving. Dimitri is happy in London,” he said. “You never know in football but only West Ham know what price they want if they decide to sell him.” Inter became the latest club to express an interest in Payet on Wednesday after they were taken over by the Chinese conglomerate Suning Commerce Group. “As a fan, I would love to see Payet in an Inter shirt,” said the honorary president Massimo Moratti. “However, the great champions are currently elusive, you have to be lucky enough to find the right opportunity. We are missing two to three players to be competitive. The important thing is to have solid players that ensure continuity.”
