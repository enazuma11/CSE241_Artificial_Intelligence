 Mark Ronson’s Uptown Funk continues to occupy the top of the UK single charts, racking up the most weeks in the coveted position since Robin Thicke’s Blurred Lines in 2013. The track has spent six weeks in the charts, five of which have been at No 1, with X Factor winner Ben Haenow stealing the slot with his Christmas single. So far, its combined chart sales figures are nearly 126,000, and it is the most streamed track of the week having been listened to over 2.45m times in the last seven days.  Elsewhere, Philip George’s Wish You Were Mine remained at No 2, while Hozier’s sleeper hit Take Me to Church has crept back into No 3 – with 25 weeks in the charts in total. George Ezra has felt the benefit of his Brit award nominations, and returns to No 1 in the album chart with Wanted on Voyage. Alongside Ezra, Ed Sheeran and Sam Smith have been the big sellers since the start of December 2014 – with each artist on rotation at the top of the album charts and notching up a combined 93 weeks inside the top 40. Smith’s In the Lonely Hour is now at No 3, while No 2 is Sheeran’s X. The highest new entry this week was Carole King with her debut album Tapestry – a 1971 album given a boost following its inclusion on US TV series Glee.
