 Supremacy, the third downloadable add-on for Activision’s monstrously successful Call Of Duty: Advanced Warfare, follows the series’ template of four multiplayer maps and an extra chapter of the celebrity cameo-infested Exo Zombies game, which adds Evil Dead star Bruce Campbell to John Malkovich, Bill Paxton and Rose McGowan, who were introduced in past instalments. Of the four multiplayer levels, Skyrise is a remake of old favourite Highrise, retaining its multi-tiered design that encourages sneak attacks; Kremlin is set in a bullet-pocked Red Square with two opposing towers overlooking a bridge and a minefield that arms itself midway through each round; Parliament sees you fighting on a futuristic boat embedded in a partially destroyed Westminster Bridge; and Compound supplies a nice mix of open spaces and claustrophobic interiors. Although there are no real standouts, it’s all competently designed, even if Exo Zombies is starting to feel a bit tired. The Call Of Duty juggernaut rolls on.
