 Theresa May has rallied her party this week at the Conservative conference, laying out her plans on everything from Brexit to immigration. But while her party seem to be behind her, what about Britain’s young people? May made it clear that she wants to break with David Cameron’s brand of Conservatism, pledging to intervene on behalf of the working class and crack down on immigration. The prime minister painted June’s referendum result as a “quiet revolution” that should force politicians to tackle public concerns. But, it’s been argued that the Brexit debate is a generational one, with younger generations largely in favour of remaining in the European Union. What’s more, About 64% of registered voters aged 18-24 went to polls to vote, but 90% of over-65s voted.  So, how to the young feel about May’s vision? Did she talk to you this week or did you find her speeches off-putting? What policies matter to you? What issues do you want to see the government address?  Wherever you are in Britain we want to hear from you to gauge a picture of the young people’s political priorities and values.
