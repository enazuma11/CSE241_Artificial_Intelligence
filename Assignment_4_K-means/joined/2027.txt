 Last term this was Leicester’s first fixture back after 10 years’ absence and they had only four men with top-flight experience. This time Everton will give the new champions a guard of honour, free beer and pizza vouchers will be given to home fans and the Italian tenor Andrea Bocelli will serenade them as the party goes on. Matty James stands by for a first appearance of the season.
