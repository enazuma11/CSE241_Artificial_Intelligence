 Electronic Arts has revealed strong revenues for the financial quarter to 30 June, but the company is also delaying two key titles. Battlefield: Hardline, an offshoot of the publisher's long running military shooter series based around a "cops and robbers" theme, will now be delayed from October 2014 to early 2015.  In a document released to support its financial announcements, EA stated: "Additional player testing has shown great excitement for this new world of cops and criminals inside the Battlefield franchise. It also showed us how, with more time, we could go deeper and innovate more." Development studio, Visceral, is apparently now "testing and implementing" new features and a beta test will be released before the launch of the game. Also delayed is fantasy role-playing adventure, Dragon Age: Inquisition, which will now hit shelves a month later than expected on 18 November. EA stated that the developer was "taking a little more time to put the final touches on the game." Electronic Arts' net revenue has risen over 50% compared with the same period in 2013. The company reported a figure of $335m for the three-month period to June 30, compared with $222m last year. The strong performance of new shooter Titanfall as well as the continuing success of the Fifa series contributed greatly, as did EA's mobile division. The company is forecasting revenues of $965m for the second fiscal quarter of 2014, bolstered by the much-anticipated release of life sim sequel, Sims 4.
