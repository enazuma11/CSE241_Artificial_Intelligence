 The father of tennis player Jelena Dokic has been charged with allegedly threatening the Australian ambassador in Belgrade. Damir Dokic's lawyer Bosiljka Djukic said that he was charged with "endangering security" of the ambassador and unlawful possession of weapons. Dokic faces up to eight years in prison if convicted. Dokic was arrested this month after he reportedly said he would blow up the ambassador's car if she did not stop negative articles about him from being published in Australian media. Police found rifles and hand grenades during the search of his house in northern Serbia. Dokic has been a controversial figure on the world tennis circuit and his daughter has alleged in the past that he beat her.
