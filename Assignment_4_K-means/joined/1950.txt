 Cricket glories in its eccentricities – all those quirky factoids, the bizarre notion of the thrilling draw, and peculiar arguments about whether or not "retired dead" deserves its place on the official list of ways of being dismissed. But this week even lifelong fanatics witnessed an oddity they had never seen before. In the second Test between India and Bangladesh at Mirpur, India's batsmen took to the field for their second innings, and were soon announced the victors – even though not one of them had scored a ­single run. What sounds like an Alice in Wonderland-style absurdity is in fact explained easily enough. With the tourists having knocked up a handy first-innings total of 544, and with Zaheer Khan having blasted his way cheaply through seven Bangladeshi batsmen, the Indians came back to the crease needing a mere two runs. And as it transpired, both of these soon arrived in the form of extras. Sundries – as some Australians still quaintly dub them – are not some optional add-on, but are integral to the sport. If wides went unpunished, bowlers would be free to protect their side's total by sending the ball out of the batsman's reach. Byes, meanwhile, keep wicketkeepers on their toes, and punish the field as a whole for allowing the ball to drift away from the action, which would be a dulling waste of time. But extras are not just a matter of discipline; the run that is scored to the team – and not to the individual – is also a reminder that a good first 11 should always be more than the sum of its parts.
