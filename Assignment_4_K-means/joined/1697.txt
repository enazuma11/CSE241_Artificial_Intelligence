 Browser gaming remains a vital proving ground for rising games design talent and all that's needed to play their creations is a web browser and the occasional free plug-in. A recent highlight from the furiously productive browser gaming scene is Olav & the Lute, which takes its cues from the point-and-click classic Loom, tasking players with overcoming puzzles in a sombre netherworld. The fantasy title is brief and basic, but that is Olav & the Loot's charm, and in a lunchbreak it can whisk you away to a ravished world that is utterly engrossing. Those who prefer something more upbeat may opt instead for Wreck, an irreverent 2D platformer focused on Miley Cyrus, who is out to assassinate her own alter ego Hannah Montana with a giant laser cannon that also serves as a jetpack. Behind the daftness of the theme lurks a solid, distinct distraction that adeptly balances absurdity and style. Equally slick is Experimental Shooter 2, a barebones 2D-action game centred on controlling a unicycle cannon in minimalist one-screen levels. A hybrid of traditional shoot 'em up and platformer, it proves that there is plenty of room for deft game design in a strikingly simple world.
