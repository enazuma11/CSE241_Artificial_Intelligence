 British No1 Andy Murray has moved up from 11th to ninth in the new world rankings released this morning. This follows his best ever grand slam performance in reaching the Wimbledon quarter-finals. There is good news too for Murray's female counterpart, Anne Keothavong, whose first-round Wimbledon victory has helped her climb to a career-high 82nd in the world. Elena Baltacha, who also reached the second round, leaps 11 places to 133rd in the world, becoming the new British No2 in the process. Rafael Nadal's epic men's final victory over Roger Federer has closed the gap on the world No1 to 545 ranking points. He could end the Swiss' stay at the top of the rankings - a position Federer has held since February 2004 - before the end of the season. Nadal only reached the fourth round of last year's US Open and a significant improvement this year will earn him a big rankings boost. Federer, meanwhile, must win the event to defend the ranking points he earned at Flushing Meadows last year. Venus Williams remains seventh in the women's rankings, even after claiming her fifth Wimbledon title on Saturday. Ana Ivanovic clings on to the women's No1 spot despite her meek third-round exit.
