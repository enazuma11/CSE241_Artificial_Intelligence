 Mad Men creator Matthew Weiner is set to realise a long-held dream and make his feature-film directing debut with the comedy drama You Are Here. "This movie has been my passion for eight years," Weiner told Variety magazine. "I can't wait to get started because the movie is about everything I care about, and I'm tired of reading it out loud to my friends." As the fifth season of his successful TV series starts, Weiner is getting underway his transition to the big screen. You Are Here is taken from a script written well before Mad Men became a cultural phenomenon, and Weiner's massive industry clout has enabled it to finally get off the ground. Weiner has secured the services of Owen Wilson and Hangover star Zach Galifianakis to star in the film, which centres around a two friends whose lives change when one of them inherits a large sum of money. Mean Girls's Amy Poehler is being lined up to co-star. Although Weiner recently signed a big-money deal that involved creating a sixth and (possibly final) seventh season of Mad Men, he hopes to start filming You Are Here within a few months.
