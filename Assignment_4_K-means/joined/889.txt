 Liverpool have reported an increase in the number of German tourists travelling to Anfield following the arrival of Jürgen Klopp as manager. The appointment of the 48-year-old has led to a surge in visitors from his home country, the club’s commercial tourism manager, Tom Cassidy, revealed. “We have seen a spike in interest from Germany since the new manager has come on board ... we have seen on the stadium tours an increase in terms of numbers,” he said. “I dealt with an inquiry this week of a German company who are bringing 55 German tour operators on a familiarisation trip. They may have come regardless of Jürgen’s appointment but I know the interest is there.” North-west England receives the highest proportion of football-driven visits in Britain with one in 10 tourists in the region going to a game, according to figures published by the tourism body Visit Britain. The research showed that some 800,000 people attended a football match while visiting Britain in 2014, spending a total of £684m during their stay. Cassidy said he was hoping that a welcome from Klopp will feature in a new stadium tour which is set to open in January 2017: “He’s a very animated character. I imagine wherever he goes he will gather interest. It’s great he’s in Liverpool.”
