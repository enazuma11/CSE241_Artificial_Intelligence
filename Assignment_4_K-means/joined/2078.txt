 Bayonetta is an icy-hearted, effortlessly stylish heroine of whose buttocks you’ll be treated to lingering shots as she performs special moves, which flow together into a hyper-violent ballet. Her job of saving the world from destruction by mythical beasts uses fists, feet, swords and guns, two of which fire directly from the heels of her boots. It’s the apotheosis of games such as Devil May Cry and Metal Gear Rising: Revengeance, the action managing to make you feel powerful and elegant, its chaos of overwrought, screen-filling attacks punctuated by moments of slow-motion “witch time” that let you string together even more psychedelically lethal combos. However, it’s only when you progress from joyous button-mashing to deliberate tactics that you discover its combat system’s extraordinary depth. Foul-mouthed, deviant and violent, it’s all the things Nintendo isn’t, which makes it a pleasantly surprising Wii U exclusive. ALSO OUT THIS WEEK   Cheerful, colourful and infused with a gentle sense of humour, Skylanders: Trap Team won’t tax you much if you play games regularly, which for its intended audience of small children is about right. As before, you put Skylander figures on a plastic disc – AKA the Traptanium Portal – to make them appear in the game. This time there’s a slot in the portal for traps, which let you suck up defeated baddies and play as them in future battles. The catch is that traps only capture specific varieties of monster, and you’ll also need a broad range of Skylanders to unlock the game’s many gated secret areas. You can use figures from previous iterations of the game, which retain all the powers you’ve earned for them, but you still need skills held only by the new Trap Masters. Its super-premium production values, charming script and genuine sense of adventure will help offset the irritation of parents being pestered for more addictively collectible Trap Masters and their slightly less expensive sidekicks.
