 People who go on to commit serious cybercrime often start out with minor thefts in online games such as World Of Warcraft, a leading detective has said. Looking at how people end up on a particular criminal path could help with early intervention, said Dr Jamie Saunders of the National Crime Agency. In an interview with the Independent, the director of the National Cyber Crime Unit said cybercriminals can do “a great deal of damage, but not in a traditional criminal way”, and explained that the crimes can start out on a small scale. “There are some sorts of criminality that youngsters don’t think of as serious,” he said. “Stealing gold off each other in online games, cheating if you like. It would be hard to imagine a knock on the door from a policeman because you’ve stolen a sword off your friend in World Of Warcraft.” World Of Warcraft is an online role-playing game which can feature thousands of players from around the world interacting with each other in a virtual universe. Saunders said the motivations of those who end up committing theft in such games are often not money, but rather the challenge or an interest in experimenting, and that some of those involved do not always realise what they are doing may be illegal. “The first point that has come out of this is that it does start with play, stealing swords and gold in online games,” he said.
