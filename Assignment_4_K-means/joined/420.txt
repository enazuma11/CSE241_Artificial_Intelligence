Today we had Will Macpherson at the Oval to watch Surrey v Lancashire and casting his beady eye on the considerably more exciting action elsewhere 
 Oh my god. What a day. 2 incredible chases. 2 promotion campaigns still alive. Garton hits three through the covers to level the scores and steal the strike. He has a big swish at Hogan, and misses. Twice. He nudges to leg but there’s no single. There’s an edge to third man and that is that! Four runs! Brown and Garton hug, then hands are shaken. Sussex are fourth.  WHAT A GAME. WHAT A SPORT.  Anyway, I’m signing off. My game finished at 12.15!!! Thanks for your company on these four fine days. It’s been a ball. But I really need to go to the pub, and I rather feel I’ve earned it! I’m on holiday next week, but am back for the penultimate round. I will see you all then, and I very much look forward to it. Keep commenting! 
 OMG THAT IS THAT. A leg-bye, then Lloyds Leach has hit a six!!!!! They’ve chased down 401 with an over to spare! 
 13 needed off 4 overs for Worcs. That’s 3 shots. Come on lads. Sussex need 24. Glamorgan need 3 wickets. Updated
 No! Adams is out for 96 at Taunton! That’s 7 (seven) 50s (fifties) without a century this season. One of the good guys, is Jimmy Adams. 
 Sussex’s target into double figures as Wright pumps TvdG through the legside for four.  But then he’s bowled through the gate!! Four in hand, 96 required. Over to you, Ben Brown, although Jofra, Briggs and Garton can all do the batting.  You can watch all this great cricket here. But don’t close the CC - live! tab. We want you to stay. 
 If Sussex can get a win, that will be a massive game. Winners are grinners, Great team performance @kentcricket ..onto Hove next week! 🙌🏼 #superkent ✌🏼️ 
 Paul Collingwood shakes hands with Ian Bell - what a lovely thought - and Warks and Durham declare their draw. Neither team out of the relegation woods yet.  
 Oh no. Joe Clarke gone now. Three in two overs for Sanderson (well bowled that man) - Worcs need 126 with five in hand. 
 Mitchell, then Rhodes go in quick succession at New Road. Clarke still there, Worcestershire still need 126 in a bit over 21 overs. Six in hand.  
 Wicket at Cardiff ... Sussex five down! Wiese bowled by Timm van der Gugten. Wright joined by Brown with 105 required. 
 Hardus Nails dismisses Luke Norwell and that is that. Dominant display from Kent, who go second, behind Essex. Eight in the match for Mr H.Nails. Updated
 Scores level at the Riverside! Patel got Stoneman but Borthwick is still there on 82, and I suspect handshake watch can begin pretty soon. 
 Timm van der Gugten is a very good looking man. WICKET: Davis is LBW off van der Gugten's bowling. Sussex 113/3 trailing by 119 runs. Next batsman is Luke Wright pic.twitter.com/vqow28Eq4v 
 Christian Davis’ stay of execution ends at Cardiff and Sussex are 106-3. Wright joins Nash. 120 required off 32 overs. Seven in hand. 
 Is there a twist in the tail at Taunton? Wheater (0) is caught behind off van der Merwe. Hampshire 191-4 (72 ov.) & trailing by 58 runs against @SomersetCCC at Taunton 
 Kent need one more. Marshall lbw b Coles 118. The New Zealander's resistance comes to an end. Glos 214-9. Matt Taylor joins Norwell 4*. pic.twitter.com/eGLICSMuet 
 Oi oi. Vince (13) is out, c Leach b van der Merwe. Wheater comes in with Hampshire needing 59 to make @SomersetCCC bat again. 191-3 in the 71st 
 I love Tim Bresnan. I absolutely love Tim Bresnan. Yes, Bresilad! @timbresnan's career-best 5-36 fires @YorkshireCCC to within 5️⃣ points of top spot 👊 💪 👏https://t.co/v8HuVA5UVs 
 We need to talk about Joe Clarke. He has 97 for Worcestershire v Northants. They need 200 from 34 overs. If he’s there at the end, they do it. 
 Surrey have signed another wicketkeeper! Welcome to Surrey CCC, Ollie Pope! (@olliepope1015). Played for Surrey since U9s and has signed a two year pro deal. pic.twitter.com/KrtonGHju8 
 Sussex lose their second, as Owen Morgan traps Luke Wells lbw, pulling. Chris Nash has 50 and Sussex need another 146 to win.
