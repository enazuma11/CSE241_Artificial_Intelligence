 The former Chelsea and Real Madrid manager Carlo Ancelotti is hoping to return to the Premier League in the near future after admitting he would “like to have another experience in England”. The Italian – who left Real at the end of last season – was linked with the Liverpool post before the Merseyside club appointed Jürgen Klopp last week. He had previously said that he intended to see out his year-long sabbatical and would not return to management until next season. However, it now appears the 56-year-old is keen to resume his managerial career sooner than that. “The vacation will continue at least until the end of the year. Then I’ll start again,” he said in an interview with the Italian newspaper Corriere dello Sport. “Where will I go? Where they call me. I will talk, evaluate and decide. Up until a few weeks ago I was scared someone would call, but now I feel like I’m getting closer to that comeback. “At least that is the plan, unless something strange happens. I am ready to get the engine back up and running in January. Ancelotti added: “I’d like to go back to the Premier League. It is the ideal environment not for football, but for the ‘game’ around football. “You can work with the right amount of pressure, the necessary detachment and calm. Before I quit, I’d like to have another experience in England. “In a while I must start to think about retirement, let’s say in five or six years. When I started out at Reggiana, I’d promised myself to work five or six years and that would be it. That was 25 years ago and I’m still going.”
