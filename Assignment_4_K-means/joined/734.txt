 The increasingly influential film section of the SXSW festival announced its lineup last night, offering its by-now characteristic mix of low-budget independent features, intrusions from the putatively hip end of Hollywood, and music-inflected documentaries. The high-profile Centerpiece slot has been given to 21 Jump Street, the new movie version of the 1980s undercover cop series which gave Johnny Depp an early career break. The film has Jonah Hill and Channing Tatum as leads, with Depp taking a cameo role. Previous Centerpiece films include Duncan Jones's Source Code, and Matthew Vaughn's Kick-Ass. The closing film is the documentary Big Easy Express, directed by music video maker Emmett Malloy, and featuring performances by Edward Sharpe and the Magnetic Zeros, Old Crow Medicine Show, and Mumford & Sons on a railroad tour of the US between Oakland and New Orleans. Elsewhere in the schedule is the world premiere of the Joss Whedon scripted horror film The Cabin in the Woods, directed by Drew Goddard, a documentary about wildman drummer Ginger Baker (of Cream and Blind Faith), and the first showing of Girls, the HBO series created by and starring Lena Dunham of Tiny Furniture renown. There will also be world premieres of The Do-Deca Pentathalon (from "mumblecore" alumni the Duplass brothers), actor Matthew Lillard's directorial debut, Fat Kid Rules the World, and Small Apartments, directed by Jonas Ã…kerlund and starring Matt Lucas. Other British interest centres around the new documentary about Bob Marley by The Last King of Scotland director Kevin Macdonald, and a US premiere for Will Sharpe and Tom Kingsley's cult hit Black Pond, which is nominated for a Bafta for outstanding British debut. The Channel 4 documentary Wikileaks: Secrets and Lies will also have its first US screening. The SXSW film programme takes place in Austin, Texas on 9-17 March.
