 Andy Murray set up a meeting with Richard Gasquet after recording a four set victory over Tommy Haas. Murray got off to a terrible start, losing the first six points of the match but then broke the German's serve in the third game, courtesy of a precise crosscourt forehand and an audacious single-handed backhand on the run and soon sealed the first set. Murray looked like he would complete a quick victory at the start of the second as he broke the Haas serve again in the third game, this time with a powerful backhand return which brought a quick glance to his coaching box and the inevitable shake of the fist. However, a sudden shift of momentum saw Haas break the Murray serve in the eighth game. The set went to a tie-break and Murray threw in a double fault at the most inopportune of moments to allow Haas to take the breaker 7-4 to level the match. It was now Haas who appeared in charge, but Murray saved two break points in the third game of the third set. The Scot was struggling for rhythm and fluency but Haas could not take advantage and Murray held it together well to take the set 6-3 when Haas pushed a forehand long to take control of the match at two sets to one. Murray did not look back and although he squandered two match points in his next game, he finally took the match 6-4, 6-7 (4-7), 6-3, 6-2 when Haas dumped a forehand into the net. Elsewhere, Andy Roddick's conqueror, Janko Tipsarevic, stormed into the fourth round with a straight sets win over the 25th seed, Dmitri Tursunov, 7-6 (7-1), 7-6 (7-3), 6-3. Tipsarevic will face Rainer Schuettler who rattled off a 6-2, 6-3, 6-4 victory over Guillermo Garcia-Lopez.  It was a successful day for France as Arnaud Clement beat Jurgen Melzer of Austria and  Gasquet sealed a date with Andy Murray by seeing off his compatriot Gilles Simon in four sets.
