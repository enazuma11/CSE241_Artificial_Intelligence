 Mark Ronson’s hold on the UK charts with the single Uptown Funk continues for its seventh non-consecutive week. Aside from a brief spell at the top for X Factor winner Ben Haenow at Christmas, the producer and musician has scored the most weeks at No 1 since Leona Lewis’s Bleeding Love in 2007. “It’s such an incredible thing to be No 1 even for one week,” Ronson told OfficialCharts.com. “It’s my first No 1 of any single I’ve ever had, so to be No 1 for seven weeks is something that just blows my mind, it’s amazing. It’s cool because it means that you guys all like what we like, which is good funk music and dance music played by musicians. It’s insane, so thank you.” The funk phenomenon is also the most streamed track of the past seven days, and soars past other tracks such as Ed Sheeran’s Thinking Out Loud, Wish You Were Here from Philip George, and Hozier’s Take Me To Church. Hozier’s sleeper hit also climbs one place to reach a new chart peak at No 2 in the UK singles charts, while Fergie, of Black Eyed Peas fame, scores her first solo UK Top 40 hit since Big Girls Don’t Cry, with L.A. Love (La La) at No 3.  Meghan Trainor’s Lips Are Movin’ has slipped to No 4, but her debut album, Title, has debuted at the top of the album charts this week. It finished 5,000 copies ahead Ed Sheeran’s X at No 2, while the rest of the top 5 consisted of previous No 1 albums: Ronson’s Uptown Special at No 3, Sam Smith’s In the Lonely Hour and George Ezra’s Wanted on Voyage at No 4 and 5 respectively.  It was a big week for indie albums, too: former Supergrass frontman Gaz Coombes makes his solo Top 40 debut with Matador at No 18, while the Charlatans’ latest, Modern Nature, slipped into the No 7 spot.
