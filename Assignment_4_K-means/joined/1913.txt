 Tim Henman, who suffered a recurrence of his back injury during the semi-final of the Zagreb indoor tournament earlier this month when he lost to Austria's Stefan Koubek, yesterday pulled out of this week's indoor tournament in Marseille. The British No1, ranked No 36 in the world, was to have played the young Frenchman, Alexandre Sidorenko, the winner of the junior title at the Australian Open last month. "I wouldn't have been able to play at 100%. I'd rather not take the chance. I still hope I can play in Rotterdam next week," Henman said. Greg Rusedski opens his season in Marseille, while Alex Bogdanovic, Britain's 21-year-old No4, climbed to a career-high No146 in the world after winning the Bergamo indoor challenger in Italy at the weekend, his second title this year. "I think I'm a lot stronger now, and Andy Murray's rise has taken a bit of the pressure off," said Bogdanovic, who is due to play in the US, including the qualifying tournament for the Miami Masters in Florida next month. "I think everybody develops at a different rate and at the moment I'm playing really well and have a lot of confidence. I just need to keep winning." Andre Agassi has withdrawn from the SAP Open tennis tournament in San Jose after experiencing severe sciatica. The eight-times grand slam champion has played only four matches since losing to Roger Federer in the US Open final last September. Karol Beck of Slovakia has been banned for two years in the latest drug scandal to rock the sport. Beck tested positive for the anabolic agent clenbuterol last September during his country's Davis Cup semi-final victory over Argentina.
