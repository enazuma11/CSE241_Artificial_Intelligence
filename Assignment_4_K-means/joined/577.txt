Neil Spencer 
 It’s odd for an eighth solo album to be self-titled, but the prolific Scots singer has never taken an orthodox approach, while this collection of originals arrives after a slew of collaborations and covers of traditional ballads. It’s personal, even if its songs come draped in antique lyricism – only Roberts would refer to a love affair as “courting” and “an uneven thing”. His reedy vocals aren’t for everyone, but his twisting melodies and cryptic imagery remain a delight, with his guitar ably supported by woodwind and, on In Dispraise of Hunger, a vocal quartet. By turns droll, pungent and lovely, it deserves more than a lo-fi production.
