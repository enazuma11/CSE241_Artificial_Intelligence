 In its opening moments, 868-Hack does everything it can to punish the player. Even with the tutorial, this abstract hacking-themed puzzle game can feel deliberately obtuse. Seconds-long games end confusingly and abruptly, as jargon glares from the screen in garish blocks of neon. But the opening mystery – what is going on? – is a compelling one. Persist for just a few minutes, and as swiftly as it was bewildering, 868-Hack’s workings become suddenly clear and the apparently arcane mechanisms reveal themselves to be an elegant, rewarding system. Backed by an ominous soundtrack, the player must move through claustrophobic grids, blasting enemies and collecting points and abilities. 868-Hack, originally released for IOS but now available on Mac, PC and Linux, captivates by imposing limitations. Vital resources to spawn points are drip-fed, while moving and shooting is rigid and restrained. Which all makes every move count in a game that is challenging, visually eccentric and a great deal more refined and considered than it first appears.
