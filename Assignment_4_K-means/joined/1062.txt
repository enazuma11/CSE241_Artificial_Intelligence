 Gaston Gaudio marched into the French Open final with a straight sets demolition of Argentinian compatriot David Nalbandian.  In a country loaded with outstanding clay-court talent, Gaudio is one of the less heralded yet he reached the final with a 6-3, 7-6 (7/5), 6-0 triumph.  The match turned decisively in his favour when Nalbandian blew a 5-1 lead in the second set and lost in a tie-break.  Gaudio sat down in his chair after being congratulated by his countryman, put his face in his hands and cried.  Next up for the Buenos Aires player will be the winner of Guillermo Coria's semi-final against Tim Henman.
