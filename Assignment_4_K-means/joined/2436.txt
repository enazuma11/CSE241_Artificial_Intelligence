 In the 1930s progressives recognised a common danger and formed a popular front against it. They should also recognise a common danger now and join forces in a new popular front. It might be called Our Country. Its aims would be simple. First, to defend democratic values against the kind of people who call judges the enemy of the people. Second, to defend liberal values against those who peddle bigotry and incivility. Third, to defend a kind of Brexit that does not make people poorer or our country weaker. These aims would command wide support. An agreed candidate could have run on them in the Richmond Park byelection. There are moments when a popular front of progressives is needed – and this is one of them.Tony WrightLabour MP, Cannock Chase 1997-2010 • Join the debate – email guardian.letters@
