 "This magnesium business is a bit strange," said Tim Henman after beating Anthony Dupuis 6-3, 6-4 here yesterday. It got stranger still with the news that Greg Rusedski and the ATP, governing body of men's tennis, agree on something.  According to Rusedski, Henman's magnesium deficiency is one of many health problems players can expect until they are provided with safe, thoroughly tested nutritional supplements to replace the nutrients lost while playing.  Now, it seems, the ATP is to answer his demands that it do something to help by signing a deal with two multinational pharmaceutical companies to produce specially tested supplements, guaranteed not to be contaminated with banned substances. Under the deal, to be announced in three weeks, each batch of supplements will be tested first by the manufacturer, then by a laboratory approved by the World Anti- Doping Agency, which criticised the ATP for its handling of the cases of Rusedski and seven other players who tested positive for nandrolone.  From January players will be able to purchase these supplements direct from the manufacturers via a secure website which will list supplements by batch number in order to ensure they can be traced.  Henman's magnesium looked in plentiful supply yesterday and he seemed a different man from the pasty, listless figure who faded in Madrid. "Last week was bad news all round," said the British No1, who plays Wesley Moodie today. "I feel I've got my energy back a bit."  While Henman is chasing Champions Race points in the hope of qualifying for the Masters Cup, Rusedski has more modest aims. Yesterday he took another step towards his goal of finishing the year back in the top 50 by reaching the quarter-finals in St Petersburg through a 7-6, 4-6, 6-4 win over Radek Stepanek. If he achieves that it will bring to an upbeat close a season in which strange business has been a recurring theme.
