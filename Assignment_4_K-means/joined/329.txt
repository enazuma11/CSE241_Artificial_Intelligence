Netflix paid less than £400,000 (€441,775) in UK corporation tax last year as the TV and movie streaming service revealed revenues of £36.5m (€40.5) in the UK. The company, which is estimated by Ampere Analysis to have almost 6 million UK subscribers, made a pre-tax profit of £1.8m (€1.99m) last year. According to the filing at Companies House in the UK, the firm’s immediate parent company is Netflix International BV, which is based in the Netherlands. As such the UK company reports its results in euros, which it classifies as its “functional and presentational currency”. Last year an investigation by the Sunday Times  claimed Netflix generated an estimated £200m in revenue in Britain in 2014 but that any profits from the UK that year were booked overseas. There is no suggestion that Netflix has broken the law. Netflix paid €441,775 in UK corporation tax in 2015, after it booked a €47,986 tax credit having filed a loss of €261,000 the previous year. “In the UK, Netflix is financially contributing in different ways with corporate taxes, wages and tens of millions of pounds in VAT as well as funding dozens of UK productions for hundreds of millions of pounds,” said a spokesman for Netflix UK.  “We have more than 30 UK projects in various stages of development. In addition to The Crown, other shows and movies include Black Mirror … and Brad Pitt’s War Machine movie. An income tax charge of approximately €441,000 makes an effective tax rate of approximately 22%.” On the subject of tax, the UK company’s filing says “management periodically evaluates positions taken in tax returns with respect to situations in which applicable tax regulation is subject to interpretation”. The UK is believed to be the biggest market for Netflix outside the US. The company, which is on track to make $8bn (£7bn) in global revenues this year and has more than 80 million subscribers, says it employs just 13 staff in the UK.  A total of €2.78m (£2.5m) was spent on wages, salaries, social security and other pension costs, meaning each employee received an average of €214,000 (£193,000). Netflix UK classifies all its employees as involved in marketing. Netflix UK says all revenue earned in the UK is for the “provision of marketing services”. In 2014, two years after launching in the UK, the company reported that it had just one UK employee. This week it emerged that Facebook’s UK business generated an £11.3m tax credit last year, despite the world’s largest social network making a global profit of $6.19bn (£4.97bn). The company reported a £4.2m tax charge for 2015.
