The zomcom epidemic of the last few years shows no sign of abating, and this piece of Austrian splatstick comes just in time for Halloween. On the last day of the ski season, a resort owner is demonstrating his new invention – a device that makes fresh snow. Unfortunately, when a Russian investor touches the mysterious green goo that powers the contraption he turns into a zombie, and the chalet party soon goes from bad to bloody. Three trapped snowboarders must escape with the help of the scene-stealing innkeeper. The slow, shambling zombies put up little resistance as they are dispatched in a series of gruesome ways involving ski poles, a snow blower and a lot of snowboards. The acting is wooden and the special effects aren’t all that special, but it’s a spirited effort and doesn’t drag during its 78 minutes. You’ll never approach après-ski in the same way again.
