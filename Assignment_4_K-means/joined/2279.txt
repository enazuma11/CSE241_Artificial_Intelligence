 Liverpool-based physical theatre ensemble Tmesis first appeared in 2003 with a trilogy inspired by a speech from Plato’s symposium positing the existence of hermaphrodites. Twelve years later, the company are once more exploring romantic love. Elinor Randle’s production resembles a Richard Curtis romcom reworked by DV8, and is absolutely full of heart – and indeed the super-sized teddy bears, chocolate boxes and sundry Valentine’s tat that confectioners and stationers begin to peddle as soon as the Christmas decorations come down. The 70-minute show seeks to define whether the concept of love is a genetic impulse or a blatant marketing exercise; and the answer seems to be a bit of both. There’s an adroit sequence of movie skits, culminating in a glorious send-up of Kate Winslet’s Titanic moment with spray and wind generated by a water pistol and a giant greetings card. The biological imperative is presented via a factual commentary scripted by Chris Fittock, which observes that the scientific term for a broken heart is takotsubo cardiomyopathy, and it is possible to die from one. The mute aggression of most physical theatre can often be an alienating experience, but Tmesis’ show seems to be entirely without cynicism. There’s a genuinely sweet moment in which the four performers entwine their limbs into various permutations of the “I love you” gesture, like Gareth Bale’s goal celebration, only even soppier. A soundtrack featuring George Michael, a-ha and Bonnie Tyler releases a heady dose of school-disco dopamine; and though it can feel a bit like being struck repeatedly in the eye with a big pizza pie, that is, as Dean Martin said, amoré. • Until 31 January.
