 The new film from Paweł Pawlikowski – moody, menacing, downbeat – takes something fro m the director's Polish compatriots Polanski and Kieslowski. It often feels like a sort of b-side to The Tenant; it could, alternatively, have worked as one of the stories in the Three Colours trilogy. Ethan Hawke plays Tom Ricks, a divorced and depressed American writer who is living in a flea pit hotel in Paris, having spent every last cent pursuing a futile custody claim. At a literary soiree, he meets a beautiful Hungarian widow, Margit (Kristin Scott Thomas); their romantic adventure reignites his literary imagination, but there is an awful price to be paid for this.  This film has to be indulged a little, and you'll have to negotiate the stumbling block that is Hawke's stodgy, dodgy French accent. Yet this movie moves at a sinuous, confident pace; it is most captivatingly odd when Margit first kisses Tom and he gulps, flinches, shudders in wordless shock, as if overwhelmed by her sensuality and force. Stephen Daldry's preposterous adaptation of the Jonathan Safran Foer novel belittles the impact of 9/11, writes Peter Bradshaw
