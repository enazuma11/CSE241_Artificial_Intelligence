Donald Glover will play Lando Calrissian in the Star Wars spinoff about the young Han Solo, Lucasfilm announced on Friday. In a statement, the studio said the film would show Calrissian long before he became the baron of a floating city in the clouds, and then the patsy of Darth Vader and a general in the Rebel Alliance.  “This new film depicts Lando in his formative years as a scoundrel on the rise in the galaxy’s underworld,” Lucasfilm said.  Glover joins Alden Ehrenreich, playing Solo, as the only named cast members of the still untitled film, which will be directed by Phil Lord and Christopher Miller. “We’re so lucky to have an artist as talented as Donald join us,” said Lord and Miller, who are best known for directing The Lego Movie and the two recent 21 Jump Street films. “These are big shoes to fill, and an even bigger cape, and this one fits him perfectly, which will save us money on alterations. Also, we’d like to publicly apologize to Donald for ruining Comic-Con for him forever.” Billy Dee Williams played Calrissian in the Empire Strikes Back, in which he and Solo hint at a history of crime capers, and Return of the Jedi, in which Calrissian, penitent but still wearing a blue cape, flies the Millennium Falcon into the second Death Star. The new film is scheduled for release in 2018, a year after Episode VIII and two years after this winter’s release of Rogue One, the first live-action Star Wars film to tell the stories of characters not named Skywalker.  Glover, 33, most recently has won critical acclaim for creating, writing and starring in the FX series Atlanta, which charts the sometimes surreal stories of two cousins in the city’s underground rap world. He also starred in four seasons of the comedy Community, wrote for the award-winning NBC show 30 Rock, and was nominated for two Grammys under his pseudonym, the Childish Gambino.
