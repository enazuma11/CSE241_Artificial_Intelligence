Peter Bradshaw 
 There's a great deal of cheerfully excessive bad taste in this broad comedy, produced by Judd Apatow. Paul Rudd and Jennifer Aniston play George and Linda, a financially stricken yuppie couple forced to sell their Manhattan apartment and move in, humiliatingly, with George's horrible brother Rick, played by co-writer Ken Marino. But they stumble on a hippie commune and decide that they would rather live there and renounce materialist values. The commune is rather like the one in Martha Marcy May Marlene, complete with sinister-charismatic bearded and guitar-playing leader, here played by Justin Theroux. The hippies have a bizarre convention of expressing applause by rubbing their fingers and thumbs together instead of clapping, because that is too invasive and disempowering. The scene in which Rudd psychs himself up for free-love sex by talking dirty to himself in the mirror is outrageously over-the-top â€“ though it caused some tutting at the screening I attended. Comedy lovers will appreciate the continuously held shot in which Rick runs after George after he has stolen his SUV.
