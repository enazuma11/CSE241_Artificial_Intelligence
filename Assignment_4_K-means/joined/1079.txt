 “Come ye human, dwarf and orcGrab your ball and stop your talk.”From The Ballad of Blood Bowl, traditional The streets will be empty, the wares rotting on deserted market stalls. Today is live draw day, and the whole kingdom must attend. From king to beggar, they come, drawn by the promise of honour and combat in the Blood Bowl field. The excitement simmers like dragon’s breath. Gather round one and all, hush thy children, the draw begineth. Nought can be the same here after; heroes will be made anon.
