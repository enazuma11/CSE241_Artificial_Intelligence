 The utterly harmless, primary coloured Pullblox World is a perfectly realised digital toy from the same developer as the peerless Advance Wars. Sequel to a lesser-known downloadable game for 3DS, this continues its legacy of puzzles solved by dragging eccentrically shaped blocks to create a path to their summit, which the game’s plump little hero can hop up. From simple beginnings, things soon get more involved, the game gently tutoring you with new techniques before getting you to apply them in increasingly complex combinations. Along with Nintendo’s usual level of polish, Pullblox World stands out in its sincere aim of letting nothing get in the way of your fun (if you fall you can simply rewind time). Elegant, deceptively simple and endlessly entertaining, Pullblox World is a tiny gem of a puzzle game that no Wii U owner should be without.  ALSO OUT THIS WEEK At the start of Murdered: Soul Suspect, trilby-wearing policeman Ronan O’Connor gets thrown out of a window and shot, leaving his ghost to spend the rest of the game tracking down his killer. Despite lacking a corporeal form, Ronan finds some paths blocked by ethereal projections from history. He can possess people and read their minds, but most are thinking identical banal irrelevancies, making a mockery of his spooky powers. The game is mostly spent in crime-scene investigation, which means wandering about looking for clues, then using trial and error to work out which ones the game thinks are the most important. It’s a wearying process made worse by the lack of signposting, which regularly fails to tell you what you’re actually meant to be doing, and voice acting that’s mostly terrible. You have to applaud Soul Suspect’s fresh ideas and premise, but when the result is this boring you might want to avoid actually playing it. Square Enix, £22.85-£55
