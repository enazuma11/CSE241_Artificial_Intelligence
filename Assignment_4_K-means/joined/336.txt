 Despite the enormous amount of publicity attracted by Margaret Thatcher biopic The Iron Lady, it was always hard to predict how the film would perform at the box office. Those who loathed her while she was in power would surely prove highly resistant. But her supporters might consider the film's depiction of her dementia to be an affront to her dignity. For those reasons, even the most optimistic predictions for debut weekend would surely have fallen well short of £2m. The Iron Lady's actual opening salvo of £2.15m is a happy outcome for distribution partners Pathe and Fox, as is the screen average of £4,901. Top site is Odeon West End (£49,332), top arthouse is Curzon Mayfair (£29,706), and top venue outside London, counter-intuitively, is Cineworld Glasgow Renfrew Street (£17,978).  The skew towards to London and the south-east mirrors the result achieved by The King's Speech with 16.33% of revenue earned in the generously defined "West End" area (includes Peckham, Brixton and Swiss Cottage), and a further 25.41% in the "London" region (which takes in many towns outside the M25, including Luton, Reading, Guildford and Chelmsford). National averages for films released in 2011 are 7.96% and 18.63% respectively. Figures for The King's Speech's opening weekend were 16.16% West End and 25.25% in outer London. One surprise is a relatively strong showing in Ireland. Not only is Cineworld Dublin The Iron Lady's second-best non-London site, but the film garnered 6.29% of its total gross in the Republic, as against 3.75% for The King's Speech on opening weekend. Figures for Northern Ireland – scene of the IRA hunger strikes that saw 10 deaths in 1981 – are 1.70% of takings for The Iron Lady versus only 0.97% for The King's Speech. The distributor partners concede that The Iron Lady did play wider in both areas, which will have been a factor, adding that Meryl Streep is a big positive in Ireland, where her films traditionally outperform the market. Another surprise is that The Iron Lady took a slightly bigger share of its earnings in Yorkshire (5.03%), scene of the miners' strike, than The King's Speech did (4.72%), but that's more down to success in upmarket York and Harrogate than, say, Bradford and Doncaster. Despite proving the market's biggest grosser on Sunday, The Iron Lady was deprived of the weekend top spot by neck-and-neck holdover titles Mission: Impossible – Ghost Protocol (£2.22m) and Sherlock Holmes: A Game of Shadows (£2.16m). Both experienced slim declines from the previous weekend of 18% and 15% respectively. The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo rose an encouraging 5%, with takings of £1.65m. While The Iron Lady slugged it out with M:I 4 and Sherlock 2 in the plexes, in the arthouses it faced tough competition from hot awards contender The Artist, expanding from a single-site platform to 106 cinemas on its second weekend. With a hefty haul of £629,000, the black-and-white crowdpleaser earned the best screen average in the market, £5,939. Top site was Curzon Soho (£22,475), followed by Curzon Chelsea, Ritzy Brixton, the Barbican and Everyman Hampstead. Outside London, top site was Duke of York's Brighton. The Artist is following a very similar pattern to Brokeback Mountain, which opened on the exact same date (30 December) six years ago, with a one-week showcase at the exact same cinema (Vue West End), before expanding to a slightly wider 125 sites on 6 January. Brokeback achieved a higher gross in its first week than The Artist did – £109,492 versus £91,554 – and the pattern has been repeated with the expansion. Brokeback stood at £987,000 at the end of its second weekend, as against £721,000 for The Artist. It's worth remembering that Ang Lee's film benefited from stronger marketable elements, including the source material (by Annie Proulx), stars (Heath Ledger, Jake Gyllenhaal) and story hook (gay cowboys). It would be wrong to characterise The Artist's UK numbers so far as in any way disappointing. For audiences not tempted by prestige Oscar contenders, gleefully bloody ice hockey comedy Goon offered a nice alternative. Cannily positioned by distributor eOne as a cheeky piece of counter-programming, the modestly budgeted picture grossed a handy £728,000, powered by the appeal of Seann William Scott, who scored on this date three years ago with Role Models, and actor Jay Baruchel, who also co-wrote Goon with Evan Goldberg (Superbad). Despite the success of The Iron Lady and the holdover titles, the market offered no match for the equivalent weekend a year ago, when new entrants The King's Speech and 127 Hours delivered a hefty double punch. Overall takings are 14% down from a year ago. Cinema owners will be hoping for strong holds from The Iron Lady and an expanding The Artist, plus fresh blood from Steven SpielbergUK b's potentially crowdpleasing War Horse. Steve McQueen's Shame, starring Michael Fassbender, joins the battle for upscale audiences, while action sci-fi The Darkest Hour, from producer Timur Bekmambetov (Night Watch, Day Watch), should suck up genre fans. 1.
