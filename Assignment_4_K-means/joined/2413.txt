 John Terry could have a say in the Premier League title race after all and may return for Chelsea against Tottenham on 2 May. Guus Hiddink has said that Terry, who has an achilles injury and has said he will leave the club at the end of the season, will travel to Bournemouth for Saturday’s match with a view to returning to the squad against title-chasing Spurs. “John is very committed,” the interim manager said. “He was very annoyed about his injury but is now recovering. He desperately wants to be with the team. I hope he will step up next week and we will see how it will go in the last couple of games. “We play on Monday week. He has to step up, starting next week. He should be training with the group at least by Thursday [to be considered to face Spurs].” Terry had a six-game absence with a hamstring problem, made his 700th Chelsea appearance as a substitute at Everton and his 701st against West Ham on 19 March but has not played since. The 35-year-old defender is out of contract this summer and revealed in January he would be leaving the Blues, who maintain the offer of a new one-year deal could be forthcoming. Incoming head coach Antonio Conte will have a major say in the future of Terry, but Hiddink says the lack of current game time will not be a factor. “They know what they have to offer each other,” Hiddink said. Goalkeeper Thibaut Courtois begins his two-match suspension after his second sending-off of the season in last week’s 3-0 loss to Manchester City, with Asmir Begovic poised to deputise. The forward Eden Hazard is in contention to return from a five-game absence with a hip and groin problem. Hiddink said: “It’s not for the whole game, I think, but he is available to play. He was training very alive and that’s a good signal.”
