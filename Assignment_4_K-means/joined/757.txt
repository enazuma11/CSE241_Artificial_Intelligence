 Tim Henman has ended his Davis Cup retirement and been named in the Great Britain squad for next month's Euro-African Zone Group One tie against Holland in Birmingham. Henman, who last played in the competition against Austria in Portschach in 2004, is joined by debutants Jamie Murray and Richard Bloomfield in the six-man squad announced today by captain John Lloyd. Andy Murray, Greg Rusedski and Jamie Baker make up Lloyd's squad, which he is still allowed to change at any time prior to the first rubber, due to take place at the NEC on April 6. Lloyd said: "I am confident we have one of the strongest teams in years for this tie against the Netherlands. It is vital for us to win if we are to work our way back into the World Group. "I am really excited about the balance of the team with huge professional experience and some really exciting young talent."  Henman, whose original retirement announcement was borne out of his desire for a more comfortable schedule in the twilight of his career, was persuaded to return after a number of meetings with Lloyd. After years of carrying the burden of the team's hopes almost single-handedly, he is also known to be excited by the prospect of handing over some of that responsibility to world number 12 Andy Murray. Meanwhile Murray's older brother Jamie has been rewarded for his magnificent doubles form with his first call-up. The 21-year-old has risen to a doubles world ranking of 43 after winning two ATP tour titles this season. Norwich 23-year-old Bloomfield has climbed to 183 in the singles rankings and earned his place on the back of some impressive performances on the Challenger circuit so far this year.
