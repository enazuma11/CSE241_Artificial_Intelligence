 This week on Tech Weekly with Aleks Krotoski, we hear about an innovative messaging system that works even if WiFi and cellular networks are down. The app is called Firechat and its creator Micha Benoliel tells us about this game-changing communication tool for Android & iOS, and why - despite all evidence to the contrary - it may actually be good for telephone companies. On the subject of telephone companies, British Telecom's broadband service experienced a major crash last week, the Guardian's telecoms correspondent Juliette Garside joins Aleks to discuss the twitter storm that ensued as the outage spread across England. Are you feeling happy, or sad? Answers to those simple questions turned out to be quite thorny, after a psychology research study published this week revealed that the social network Facebook manipulated our feeds to learn about our emotions. Aleks is joined by Guardian technology editor Charles Arthur and Guardian tech reporter Alex Hern to discuss whether Facebook are in the right or the wrong over this experiment. And, finally, Guardian apps expert Stuart Dredge discusses the latest app update by the Berlin-based audio social site SoundCloud and why their focus on listeners rather then creators might mark a shift in direction for the company.
