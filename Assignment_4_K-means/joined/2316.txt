Marks and Spencer has announced plans to close more than 80 stores over the next five years, 30 in the UK and the rest abroad as part of a major overhaul. It plans to reduce its reliance on its poorly performing clothing business, focusing on food sales instead. This comes after a “forensic review” of operations in the UK and abroad, according to the M&S chief executive Steve Rowe. Rowe has already promised to lower its clothing prices and pay more attention to its most loyal group of shoppers, dubbed “Mrs M&S”. Analysts say these fifty-something women had been neglected as the store chased younger shoppers. In the UK, 30 stores will shut, and a further 45 will have their clothing departments closed or be relocated. What do you think of these plans? What are your favourite M&S products? Do you think a move away from clothing is smart or are you upset? Do you prefer food products? What do you think are the best and worst aspects of what M&S has to offer? How should they improve?
