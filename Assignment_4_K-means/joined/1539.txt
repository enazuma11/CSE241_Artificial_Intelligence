Alexander Sokurov narrates this disjointed, sporadically profound documentary about the Louvre gallery. And this is one of the most off-putting issues – there’s an unlovely self-importance to Sokurov’s droning diatribe that rather distracts from the cultural significance of the subject. But if you can get past the narration, and Sokurov’s tricksy devices, this cinema essay is a handsomely mounted history lesson.
