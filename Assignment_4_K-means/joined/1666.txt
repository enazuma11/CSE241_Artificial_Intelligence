 Shares in GoPro have dropped more than 10% amid speculation Apple could be entering the wearable cameras market after it was granted a new patent. But the patent may not indicate such a move by the tech company. The patent in question was actually filed by Kodak in 2012, and only came under Apple’s control as part of a slate of patents bought by consortiums led by Apple and Google for $525m. The patent, which cites specific weaknesses in GoPro’s cameras, includes details about a camera system that can be mounted on bike helmets or scuba masks, and was reported to have been filed by Apple. Seemingly as a result, shares of GoPro, the market leader in wearable cameras, plummeted by 12% over the course of Tuesday. The patented camera system could also be used under water to take pictures and record sounds, according to the application. But just because Apple now owns the patent, does not mean it intends to actually release any such device. JMP Securities analyst Alex Gauna said it was premature to assume that Apple would soon launch a wearable camera. “It does not seem to me that launching an action camera accessory is the most logical product extension for Apple to pursue right now,” Gauna told Reuters. Wearable cameras are a popular gadget, particularly among sporting types, who mount them on helmets, boards, bikes and skis to record events. They’re especially popular among cyclists, where they have an additional use when it comes to establishing liability in the case of an accident. But some question whether the wearable camera’s existence as a standalone gadget may be coming to an end in the face of increased competition from smartphones. “I’ve long been wondering if GoPro is just the next Flip,” writes tech journalist John Gruber, referring to a briefly popular brand of stand-alone HD video cameras. “Remember them?” • Apple loses $24m patent lawsuit to pager firm
