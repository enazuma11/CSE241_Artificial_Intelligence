 Liverpool are set to bolster their defence with the £4.2m signing of the Augsburg centre-back Ragnar Klavan. Following achilles injuries to Mamadou Sakho and Joe Gomez and the loss of Martin Skrtel, recently sold to Fenerbahce, and Kolo Touré (released) the manager, Jürgen Klopp, is keen to bring in the 30-year-old to give him more options. Klavan impressed against Liverpool for the Bundesliga side in both legs of last season’s Europa League tie which the Merseysiders won 1-0 on aggregate. At present Klopp has only two fit first-team centre-halves in Joel Matip and Dejan Lovren and even Matip limped off with an ankle injury during Liverpool’s 2-0 friendly win over Wigan Athletic on Sunday. The manager insisted afterwards that the former Schalke defender was “fine” but is well aware he needs defensive reinforcements. The game, at the DW Stadium, was won with second-half goals from Danny Ings and 16-year-old Ben Woodburn. It was also notable for Philippe Coutinho’s return to the starting lineup following his Copa América exertions. The Brazilian enjoyed a 45-minute run-out in the Wigan sunshine as Ings – who missed much of the last campaign with a knee injury – scored his second goal of pre-season in the 70th minute. Soon afterwards Woodburn continued his impressive friendly form with the second goal. Liverpool started the game with Roberto Firmino and the recent £30m signing Sadio Mané in attack. There was also a glimpse of Liverpool’s forgotten man Lazar Markovic, who arrived in the second period.
