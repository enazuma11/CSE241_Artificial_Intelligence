Where were you when Steven Finn took England’s first World Cup hat-trick and only their fourth in ODIs after Jimmy Anderson (v Pakistan, The Oval 2003), Steve Harmison (v India, Trent Bridge, 2004) and Andrew Flintoff (v West Indies, St Lucia, 2009)? Probably still under the duvet stewing about the lack of yorkers in the preceding 49 overs. Eoin Morgan’s last nine balls against Australia: OUT, OUT, OUT, dot, dot, dot, dot, dot, OUT. May just explain why “Alastair Cook” trended briefly on Saturday morning. The @ECB_cricket Twitter feed: “This game is poised nicely as we enter the last 10 overs of Australia’s innings, #Aus 237-5. Come on England!” With grim inevitability a further 105 runs followed. “Geoffrey [Boycott] tends to be critical 24/7 and I know for people in the team it falls on deaf ears.” – Eoin Morgan. Streaking: two matches in two different countries on Saturday produced two streakers. Will a wide-angle shot of a naked man being rugby-tackled by luminous stewards become this World Cup’s vuvuzela?
