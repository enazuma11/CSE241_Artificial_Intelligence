 Five questions Ridley Scott's Blade Runner sequel must answer: 1. Did Sean Young's Rachael live a normal life span, as predicted in the original theatrical release, or peg it after only a few short years, as suggested in the director's cut? Will Young make a comeback in the sequel? The actor, who checked into rehab in 2008 following an intoxicated outburst at an awards ceremony, recently said she is pursuing film work once again. 2. Will the studio once again shoe-horn in an unwieldy, last minute Ford voiceover aimed at offering wholly unnecessary exposition to bemused viewers, or stick with the sublimely enigmatic style of Scott's cut? 3. Will anyone want to take out product placement ads in the sequel, considering the famous "Blade Runner curse"? Atari, Bell and Pan Am – all featured in the film – are among the more high-profile companies which have gone out of business or lost their market-leading position since 1982. 4. If replicants only survive four years, wouldn't someone have corrected the design fault that made them perfect cold-blooded killers before the next batch were let loose, removing the need for Blade Runners and therefore Blade Runner 2? 5. Lastly, and most importantly, is Ford's Deckard himself a replicant? If he's still alive more than 30 years on, that would suggest the character is definitely human, destroying one of the original film's most enjoyable mysteries. Of course, Scott might reveal that Deckard is a special replicant with an extended lifespan: either way, Ford's presence would demand that a puzzle which has had film fans arguing for more than three decades finally be addressed.
