 Wii Fit U promises to enhance wellbeing by gamefying your exercise regime and giving you metered feedback on every aspect of it, from your weight and centre of gravity, to the number of steps you take each day. The result is a program that actually manages to turn keeping fit into a game, even if hardened gym regulars might question how robust it is. For gymphobes, the sudden realisation that your lifestyle is sedentary enough to be a threat to your very existence make it a gateway drug to full fitness.
