 As part of our Hack Day today, we’d like to introduce you to the Guardian Sous-Chef Facebook messenger bot. It is our first foray into chat messaging apps, and we are interested in what you make of it.  You can find Guardian Sous-Chef on Facebook, and send it a message. When you do, the chef should introduce itself, and then give you the opportunity to find recipes to cook from the Guardian and Observer’s website. We’ve done some testing of it interacting with humans in controlled conditions, and now we are going to make it available for a limited time so that we can assess how people use it, and how well it copes once it encounters real people. Be gentle with it...
