 Google Maps is to remove an aerial image that shows the body of a 14-year-old boy, who was shot and killed in 2009. Richard Barrera, the boy's father, told San Francisco's KTVU-TV over the weekend that he became aware of the image of his son Kevin earlier in the week and wanted Google to take down the image out of respect. "When I see this image, it's still like that happened yesterday," Barrera told the news station on Sunday. "And that brings me back to a lot of memories." The image shows what appears to be a body on the ground near a railway line with several other people, presumably investigators, and what looks like a police car nearby. It was visible on Google's website on Monday. Brian McClendon, vice president of Google Maps, said in a written statement sent to media outlets that replacing the image will take about eight days. "Google has never accelerated the replacement of updated satellite imagery from our maps before, but given the circumstances we wanted to make an exception in this case," he said. McClendon said Google had spoken to the Barrera family "to let them know we're working hard on the update." Kevin's body was found on a path near railroad tracks that separate North Richmond from San Pablo on 15 August, 2009. His killing remains unsolved. Police believe Kevin was killed in the same spot the night before his body was found. They have not established a motive for the killing or identified any suspects.
