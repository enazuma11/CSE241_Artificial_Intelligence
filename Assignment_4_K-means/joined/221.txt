 Those of us who know and love Notting Hill’s Café Lisboa will be disturbed by Gaby Hinsliff’s suggestion that David Cameron and George Osborne were there “chillaxing over a flat white” (Under May the cool kids are out, age and experience are in, 16 July). Café Lisboa is very much part of the old Notting Hill, not the Tory party’s “Notting Hill set”. This means it is one of the many businesses owned and run by immigrants, in this case Portuguese, which made the area one of the first multicultural communities in the country. If our former PM and chancellor had any familiarity with the Lisboa, they will have known to order the milky coffee served in a glass there, and known as a galão, perhaps along with a pastel de nata (custard tart).Paul MossLondon • Join the debate – email guardian.letters@
