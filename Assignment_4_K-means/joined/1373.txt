Linbury Studio, LondonSean Gandini and choregrapher Ludovic Ondiviela search for no less than the meaning of life in this witty dance-circus mashup 
Lyn Gardner 
 We all try to make order out of the chaos of our lives and find an underlying pattern. That impulse is taken to the extreme in Gandini Juggling’s latest piece, in which manipulation meets dance and a new composition, Suspended Opus 69 by Nimrod Borenstein, head-on. It’s no car crash. It’s an evening in which mathematical perfection is always scuppered by human failings, or indeed by a dropped ball, yet the obsessive search for it continues. But who could live with the purity of perfection, and who would want a world in which the body was a mere machine? This piece may not benefit from the mix of absurd dottiness and viciousness that made Gandini’s Smashed such a special show, but if the company’s Clowns and Queens turned lust into an erotic tango of desire (with extra balls), so 4x4 turns all life into a dance; one that is physical, cerebral and very much aural. There are times in this show directed by Sean Gandini and choreographed by Ludovic Ondiviela when it’s hard to see where the limbs stop and the clubs begin, or where the arc of a ball becomes extended by the arm of a dancer. Sometimes the dancers cling to the jugglers, sometimes they seem like an extension of thought itself; at others they wheedle and needle. This is a show of elegant, wistful beauty, in which the spatial becomes something you can almost reach out and touch. At times it feels like a game of chess. Like much of Gandini’s work, it has a cool gaze but never a cold heart, while it obsessively and wittily looks for the meaning of life in the mathematical patterns of bodies and sound. • Until 15 January.
