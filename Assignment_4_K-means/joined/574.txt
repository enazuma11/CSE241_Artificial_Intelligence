 The tiny student team behind 4PM have made a number of bold design choices in crafting their story-cum-game. It explores alcoholism, for one, with the lead character struggling to hold her professional life together and come to terms with her past. Equally, it is exceedingly short, coming in at around half an hour on the first play-through, with little reason to return more than a couple of additional times to explore variations in the narrative. Furthermore, interaction is streamlined, with the player effectively walking the protagonist through each scene, making occasional choices that affect the conclusion. As a result, many gamers are likely to ignore 4PM. After all, it lacks the spectacle and excess that so many consider defining qualities of "real" games. 4PM's world is a place without heroics; sex doesn't sell here, there are certainly no car chases, and there's little time even for triumph or success. Which is exactly why others will revel in exploring this distinct game world, as it probes some of the darker realities of life. For this is a truly striking creation; a well-written, thoughtful short story in video game form that will intrigue fans of succinct narrative adventures such as Gone Home and Dear Esther, even if it fails to quite meet their standard of excellence. It is somewhat technically limited, but the cinematography in every scene is considered with care and to great effect, and for those willing to throw pocket change at something different, it is a fascinating example of a game's ability to challenge and provoke without using brute sensationalism as a tool.
