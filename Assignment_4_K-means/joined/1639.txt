Peer says Theresa May’s talk of social mobility and leadership of Brexit makes Conservative party her ‘natural home’ Press Association 
 Theresa May’s leadership has persuaded a former Lib Dem peer to switch to the Tories. Zahida Manzoor said she was impressed by the prime minister’s talk of promoting social mobility. “Leaving the Lib Dems, where I’ve been a member for three years in the House of Lords, was tough, but it was the right thing to do. I could not support the leadership of a party that calls itself democratic and then refuses to acknowledge the will of the people in a referendum,” she said. “Theresa May’s vision of a Britain that works for everyone, and her clear leadership over Brexit, now make the Conservatives a natural home for me and millions of people like me, from all communities across the UK. “As Britain embarks on a new journey, outside the EU but reaching out to trade with the world, and as we really begin addressing the problems of social mobility at home, I look forward to helping play my part as a Conservative,” Lady Manzoor added.
