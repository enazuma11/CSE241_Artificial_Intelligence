 The record shows a magnificent seven wins from seven outings for Pep Guardiola’s Manchester City. The Catalan is already creating the myth that a side can be beaten before they walk past the white line for kick-off. Can, then, Bournemouth do what no other side has yet and, at least, fashion a draw? It appears a slim prospect even though City are without the sublime and prolific Sergio Agüero, who is suspended.
