Samantha Bee has criticized Donald Trump’s performance in the final debate, referring to him as a “dick-waving Berlusconi knock-off”. In this week’s episode of Full Frontal with Samantha Bee, the host discussed the Republican candidate’s poor performance last week, claiming that his policy positions were decided “by dumping out Risk on to the floor and reading the pieces like tea leaves”. She also discussed the inaccurate way in which he spoke about abortion after he claimed that they could be conducted one day before the due date. “Removing a baby from a woman’s womb in the ninth month isn’t an abortion, it’s a birth,” she said. She went on to praise Hillary Clinton’s defense of women who deserve the right to take control over their own bodies.  “Men, if you don’t get why it’s important to have a woman as a major party nominee, check your social media feed,” she said. “Actually, log in as your wife. You’ll see that all week, women have been sharing deeply personal stories of pregnancies that went wrong.” Bee also brought up the party response to Trump refusing to confirm whether he would accept the results of the election. “Looking at the results of a democratic election and saying ‘fuck that’ has been official Republican policy for at least eight years now,” she said.  She also placed the blame for the accusations of a “rigged” election on John McCain, illustrating his use of similar terms during his candidacy.  “Spare us the handwringing, GOP,” she said. “If you leave loaded guns lying around the house, it’s only a matter of time before a four-year-old picks one up and pulls the trigger.” She also found time to criticize the media for praising Trump’s less flustered portion of the debate. “Our media is so punch-drunk from the 16-month Hindenburg explosion of Trump’s candidacy, they no longer notice how awful he is unless he hulks out on stage or grabs the foundational principles of our republic by the pussy,” she said.
