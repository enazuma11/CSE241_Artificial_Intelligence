A stray cat moves in with a homeless junkie; eats his food; watches dispassionately as he squirms and sweats his way through cold turkey. Admittedly, the story doesn’t have quite the dramatic peaks and troughs of, say, Lassie saving a trapped child or Old Yeller chasing off a bear intent on snacking on a little boy. But then we have different expectations of cats and of dogs. Dogs are plucky, loyal, lifelong companions. With cats, it’s sometimes just enough to make it through the night without getting our faces clawed off. That said, Bob, who appears as himself in this film (alongside six other ginger feline lookalikes), is a particularly gorgeous specimen. And Bob’s weapons-grade cuteness is almost enough to power this slight but warm-hearted film by Roger Spottiswoode (a veteran of the animal/human buddy movie genre, he also directed Turner & Hooch). Bob’s human companion, busker James Bowen, is played by Luke Treadaway, who conveys convincingly the jittery emotional chaos of a former addict.
