 The ATP is poised to hand over all its drug-testing procedures after the World Anti-Doping Agency found major faults in its handling of the seven cases of players who tested positive for nandrolone between August 2002 and May last year.  Wada will issue a report today which will be critical of the way the ATP, the ruling body of men's professional tennis, handled the cases of Bohdan Ulihrach and six other players, and its failure to take at least one to the Court of Arbitration for Sport.  Ulihrach was absolved, after initially being suspended, because the ATP said it could not be sure its own trainers had not handed out contaminated electrolyte replacement pills, and the six other players were similarly cleared. It has since been established that the trainers were not involved, but the source of the nandrolone has never been discovered.  Since May of last year another rash of nandrolone cases has been reported, including about 20 this year. Britain's Greg Rusedski, the only player whose sample exceeded the concentration allowed by the IOC and other sporting bodies, based his defence on the fact that the seven other players had been exonerated and he was cleared by an independent tribunal in March.  Wada was unhappy with the verdict and will amplify its concerns today, after which Mark Miles, the ATP's chief executive officer, is expected to press for the organisation, which is 50% owned by the players and therefore open to criticism of bias, to appoint an outside agency to carry out its drug testing.  Rusedski defeated the Slovakian Karol Beck 3-6, 6-3, 7-6 yesterday to reach the quarter-finals of the Mercedes-Benz Cup in Los Angeles. He now faces Nicolas Kiefer.  "I am on a roll. This has been a fantastic start to the summer for me," he said. "It has been two years since I won seven straight matches, so that gives me a lot of confidence and makes me feel good about myself."
