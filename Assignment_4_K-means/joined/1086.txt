Claire Hardaker on the complexity of understanding the internet troll. Also the tech team discuss Hewlett-Packard and Tesco’s Hudl 2 Presented by Alex Hern with Charles Arthur and Samuel Gibbs and produced by Jason Phipps 
 Claire Hardacker is a University of Lancaster expert in computer mediated communication, with a focus on the area of trolling, cyber-bullying and grooming. She talks to Alex Hern about trolling in the wake of the death of Brenda Leyland, linked to online trolling of Kate and Gerry McCann. Claire points out (as she also does in a recent article) that Leyland did not conform to the classic definition of the troll and that this tragic case highlights the complexity and dangers for all users of social media. Alex is joined by Charles Arthur and Samuel Gibbs to discuss the recent announcement by the technology giant Hewlett-Packard that the company will split into two parts. They also discuss Tesco's second-generation own-brand tablet the Hudl 2. Samuel says it's a great piece of kit – but can it battle the Google Nexus? And will it save Tesco's troubled entertainment streaming platform Blinkbox? Listen to the podcast and leave your comments below.
