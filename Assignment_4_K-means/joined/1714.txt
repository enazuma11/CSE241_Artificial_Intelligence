A new poll suggests Corbyn remains very popular with Labour members - are you one of them? 
James Walsh 
 Jeremy Corbyn is more popular than ever with Labour members, according to a Times/YouGov poll. Despite the party’s mixed results in May’s elections, of those polled 50% of party members said they would “definitely” vote for him again, and 14% would “probably” do so. The poll also found little support for potential leadership rivals. If you’re a Labour member, we’d like to hear your views on how Labour are doing under Jeremy Corbyn. When we last asked our readers back in December, we found the majority were happy with Corbyn’s first three months in charge - though you had suggestions for how he could improve. Are you still happy with Labour’s direction? What has impressed you, and how do you think the party needs to improve? Do you share Corbyn’s assessment that Labour needs to improve if they’re to win in 2020? What did you think of the recent election results: were they encouraging for the party? Is the party doing enough to reconnect with voters? You can share your views by filling out the form below.
