 The government’s appeal against a decision granting parliament a vote on article 50 moved to the supreme court this week. And with a decision due in January, the March deadline for triggering Brexit talks is moving ever-closer. The EU’s chief negotiator Michel Barnier used a speech to set out the EU’s basic starting position and to declare that the UK would not be allowed to “cherry-pick” what it wants from the single market.  We hear from the former attorney general Dominic Grieve, an ardently pro-EU Conservative MP who runs through the history of the royal prerogative. The supreme court also heard how claims from the devolved parliaments to be involved in triggering article 50. This week the SNP has reiterated warnings that proceeding without the consent of the SNP-dominated Scottish parliament could spark a constitutional crisis. We hear from the party’s Brexit spokesman Stephen Gethins. Plus: following Dame Louise Casey’s major review of integration in the UK, we hear from Labour MP Chuka Umunna on the policy implications of her recommendations. And joining Anushka Asthana in the studio to discuss the report are Sunder Katwala of the thinktank British Future, Phoebe Griffith from the IPPR and Shaista Gohir of the Muslim Women’s Network.
