 There’s no two ways about it - social and digital media have become a colossal part of our everyday lives. Wake up and check your @mentions. Post that Instagram of your delicious meal. Make a Snapchat story of your visit to the chemists. We share virtually everything we do with the rest of the world, and consume content from these non-traditional platforms as well. And the same rule applies to politics. In the US presidential election, each candidate has adopted social and digital media strategies to reach new audiences and bring people into the political process. This new approach to political outreach has revolutionised the way politicians connect with voters. Leigh Alexander and Elena Cresci speak to the digital director of Bernie Sanders’ presidential campaign, Kenneth Pennington, about how he and his team used social and digital media to attract voters. Plus, he explains the origin of the #FeelTheBern hashtag.
