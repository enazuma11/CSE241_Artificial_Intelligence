 Justine Henin-Hardenne's performance in a 6-1 6-2 victory over Amelie Mauresmo in Berlin was so pumped up that it gave the impression she had not forgotten the aftermath of their last meeting, in the final of the Australian Open. The French and German Open champion was so focused in her brilliantly patterned game, and so completely outplayed the world number one, that it felt more like a sequel to the Melbourne controversy than another instalment in the defence of her German Open title. In Melbourne, Henin-Hardenne had received widespread criticism for failing to finish the final and Mauresmo had conspicuously declined to distance herself from those comments. Now the Belgian came out like a crouching tiger and apart from a brief blip when she let slip her break of serve at 3-1 in the second set never ceased the savage mauling. The force of her attack, especially from her less-vaunted forehand wing, was remarkable for someone so slightly built and the level of her adrenalin was unusual for a semi-final. Mauresmo clearly looked jaded from the effort of having to resume her quarter-final match against Martina Hingis earlier in the day and Henin-Hardenne exploited that to the maximum, keeping her at full stretch and eventually wrapping up victory in just 57 minutes. 'Some would say she shouldn't get the credit for this because I was tired, but I wouldn't take that option,' Mauresmo said, apparently aware of the contradiction in her words. Henin-Hardenne denied that her form had been related to what had happened in Australia. 'Every time I play someone I have lost to, I try to get my revenge,' she said. But then her racket did most of the talking. It will attempt to complete the story today against Nadia Petrova of Russia in a repeat of last year's final.
