Peter Bradshaw 
 Marc Evans's Hunky Dory is sentimental, sweet-natured and daft as a brush. It is set in a Welsh secondary school in the boiling hot summer of 1976; the whole film is shot in a Hipstamatic retro-nostalgia glow. Minnie Driver is Viv, the free-spirit English teacher trying to turn the kids on to Shakespeare, and to do this, she gets them all together for a school production of The Tempest using the music of, erm, David Bowie. Along the way, the emotional temperature rises to match the sweltering heat outdoors: kids fall in and out of love, and wonder if they might be gay, and there are ideas pinched from Glee, backdated to the era of Fame. It's all very silly, and that teenage school orchestra sounds suspiciously accomplished. Yet, in its goofy way, Hunky Dory is likable, and Robert Pugh is good as the gruff headmaster, drafted in to play Prospero.
