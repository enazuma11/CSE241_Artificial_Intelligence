Thousands of Post Office workers are set to stage a 24-hour strike next week as part of a dispute over branch closures, jobs and pensions. We would like to hear from you if you are one of them. The Communication Workers Union, which claimed the Post Office was now at “crisis point”, said its members will walk out on 15 September after voting for industrial action last month. The strike vote applies to crown branches, which are directly managed by the Post Office but represent only 300 of the 11,600 branches in the UK. We would also like to get to know more about the issues that affect you at work if you are not directly involved – perhaps you are not a member of the union or work in an unaffected branch.  You can share your views by filling out the form below, anonymously if you wish, and we’ll use some of them in our reporting.
