 After the cardigan, the storm. If those who predict that Rafael Nadal is the man to end Roger Federer's five-year monopoly of the Challenge Cup required further evidence for their claims, the Spaniard provided it with a ruthlessly efficient serving display to seal a 6-4, 6-4, 7-6 (7-0) win over German qualifier Andreas Beck on the same afternoon that fourth seed Nikolay Davydenko was unceremoniously dumped out in the opening round. Nadal, who did not face a break point throughout, served 17 aces and found the court with over 70% of his first serves, impressive statistics that would have been unthinkable a year ago. The Spaniard may lack Federer's sartorial elegance, but his vastly improved delivery could prove the key to derailing the champion's bid for a record-equalling sixth consecutive title. Nadal's authoritative performance was all the more striking for the obduracy shown by Beck, who belied a world ranking of 122 with a solid display that saw him broken just twice on his grand slam debut. "The first match is always very difficult," said Nadal, who now faces up-and-coming Latvian teenager Ernests Gulbis. "He served a lot into the body, and it was difficult for me. We didn't play a lot of points from the baseline, and my game is playing points from the baseline." It was a better afternoon for Germany elsewhere, as Benjamin Becker overcame Davydenko in straight sets, 6-4, 6-4, 6-4. While never a major force on grass - before reaching last year's fourth round, he had lost in the first round on four of his five previous visits to the All England Club - Davydenko, the world No4, looked subdued even by his modest standards.  The evocatively-named Becker, who had himself lost in the opening round of his last six majors, fired down 10 aces, although the more telling statistic was a haul of 86% points won on his first serve.  Becker's success completed a resoundingly successful day for the German contingent, with Nicolas Kiefer and Tommy Haas also winning through to the second round. Kiefer was a straight sets victor over Julien Benneteau of France, 6-1, 7-5, 6-3, while Haas recovered from the loss of the opening set to notch up a 3-6, 6-4, 6-4, 6-4 win over Argentina's Guillermo Canas.
