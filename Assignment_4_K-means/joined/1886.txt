 Film-maker John Akomfrah has devised a collage of quotations and archival clips, and constructed an audio-visual meditation on the themes of myth and memory, journeying and homecoming, inspired by Telemachus's search for his father Odysseus in Homer's epic poem. The result is engaging and pregnant with ideas, although some of the juxtapositions work better than others. The film's thematic centre is the fraught and painful migrant experience in Britain in the 60s and 70s: African-Caribbean incomers were encouraged to find work in the former "mother country", but discovering a postwar Britain wretchedly bigoted and down-at-heel. The monochrome news clips of Britain Akomfrah finds always look wintry and cold, and some of the poverty looks as if it could have been photographed at any time in the previous 100 years. Periodically, Akomfrah will show mysterious images of people in different coloured coats with their back to the camera, in stark and snowy Alaskan landscapes: I wondered if he intended an allusion to Caspar David Friedrich's painting Wanderer above the Sea of Fog. A thoughtful cine-essay.
