Eurostar rail workers are planning seven days of strike action this month in a dispute over work-life balance. The Rail, Maritime and Transport (RMT) union says the dispute is over unsocial hours and duty rosters for about 80 train managers. Members of the RMT union will walk out from 00.01am on Friday 12 August until 11.59pm on Monday 15 August and for three days over the bank holiday weekend from 27 August. The union said the dispute centred on Eurostar’s failure to honour an agreement from 2008 that sought to ensure that train managers could expect a good work-life balance in terms of unsocial hours and duty rosters. A Eurostar spokesperson said all passengers with reservations will be able to travel, and days with planned strikes will see small changes to timetables.
