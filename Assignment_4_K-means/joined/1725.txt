 A US federal judge has ruled against a group of Chicago police officers who argue they are owed millions of dollars in overtime for responding to work-related calls and emails on their smartphones while off-duty. Sergeant Jeffrey Allen brought the class-action lawsuit five years ago. He and about 50 other members of an organised crime unit said the city owed them millions as back pay but they had been effectively banned from claiming it. They argued they had faced pressure, under an unofficial departmental policy, not to claim overtime for off-duty work on their smartphones.  The officers’ attorneys argued they were often browbeaten into not claiming overtime for phone work, and that it was bosses’ responsibility to make sure overtime was fairly compensated. The case was being watched for its potential to help answer what it means for employees to be off the clock in the age of smartphone technology. Magistrate Sidney Schenkier said the department’s policy could have been clearer but there was insufficient evidence of a policy not to compensate off-duty phone work.  The city had established practices for filing overtime and didn’t do anything to prevent officers from using it, she said. An attorney for the officers, Paul Geiger, told the Chicago Tribune he planned to appeal. “The message this decision sends to employers looking for guidance on off-duty smartphone or computer use is a terrible one,” he said. “Employers can now implement a rule forbidding off-duty smartphone use, not enforce that rule, and manage to get away with not paying employees. That is wrong.”
