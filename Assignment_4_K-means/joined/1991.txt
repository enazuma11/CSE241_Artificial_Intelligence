 Maria Sharapova's pink dress was the fashion talk of Roland Garros yesterday, but few spent much time discussing her tennis after the American-based Russian teenager struggled horribly to beat the 29-year-old American Mashona Washington 6-2, 5-7, 7-5 on court Suzanne Lenglen. It was not a surprise. The world No4 had not played competitively since April, having injured her right foot during an exhibition match. She pulled out of all the build-up clay court tournaments and aggravated the injury during practice here last Friday. Initially she did not appear constricted in her movement and took the opening set with some ease. But Washington, ranked No89, went for her shots with unrestricted abandon to square the match and at the end of the second set Sharapova, clearly limping, had her foot re-strapped. Washington took a 5-2 lead in the third set and had three match points but her nerve failed her and Sharapova seized on the weakness with a ferocity few other women can match.
