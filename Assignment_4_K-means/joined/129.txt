 "It's a cross between Paradise and Paradise!" The speaker is Mohamed Nasheed in 2009, president of the Maldives and star of this documentary about the global climate change causing sea levels to rise, threatening to engulf his homeland entirely – turning it into the ultimate failed state. (Actually Nasheed is now the ex-president, forced out in February this year after opposition protests that he claims were orchestrated.) For 30 years, from the late 1970s, the Maldives were ruled by a dictator, Maumoon Abdul Gayoom. One detractor was Nasheed, the figurehead of a pro-democracy movement that swept Maumoon from office, and who was tortured while in prison. Shortly after gaining power, Nasheed became preoccupied with climate change. His little nation is a microcosm of the whole endangered world. Could Nasheed be the political Prospero to save the island – and the planet? Well, now he is out of power, and the Copenhagen summit was a disappointment. Perhaps his advocacy will help to bring the climate change issue back into political fashion.
