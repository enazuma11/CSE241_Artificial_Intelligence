Same-store sales at French Connection Group returned to growth in the first half of its financial year, buoyed by a strong performance of its spring/summer collection.  However, total revenue at the British fashion retailer fell 8.7% to £69.2m after the closure of some stores, and the company reported a pre-tax loss of £7.9m Like-for-like sales in the UK and Europe, which accounted for 74% of group sales in 2015, rose 6.5% in the six months to 31 July. They fell 10.7% in the same period last year.  After the success of its FCUK logo, which helped drive the company’s shares to more than £5 in 2004, French Connection has struggled in recent years amid competition from cheaper, fast-fashion rivals such as Zara, Asos and Forever 21.  French Connection has not reported an annual pre-tax profit since the year ended 31 January 2012, and the stock is down more than 90% from its 2004 highs.
