 Tommy Haas v Andy Murray The British No1's encouraging form will be tested by the German, who has won six successive sets here this year and who also won their last meeting. Janko Tipsarevic v Dmitry Tursunov  This could have been Andy Roddick v Chris Eaton, a match that would have taken the Surrey qualifier's public profile to stratospheric levels. Instead we have a contest between two talented players that promises to be pleasing on the eye.  Elena Dementieva No5 v Gisela Dulko Apart from a quarter-final appearance in 2006 the Russian has never got beyond the fourth round at Wimbledon. Having got a bye to the third following Lindsay Davenport's retirement due to injury, the 23-year-old Argentinian should be fresh for this one. A cloudy start with spots of drizzle followed by sunny spells later on. Temperatures should reach 23C. TV Live on BBC1 from 1.45-6pm and BBC2 12-3.25pm and 5.50-8pm. Highlights on BBC2 8-9pm.
