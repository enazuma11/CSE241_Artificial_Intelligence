Some horror films clatter; others like to creep. Kiyoshi Kurosawa’s Japanese chiller moves with the softest of steps, observing its characters from behind or through glass partitions as Hidetoshi Nishijima’s criminologist reopens a cold case that points distressingly close to home. This procedural subplot can feel a little machine-tooled. Much of the dialogue veers towards exposition. But the tension is building; the slow-burn pays dividends. By the time the camera swings into the yard and approaches the house, we realise we’ve come much too far to turn back.
