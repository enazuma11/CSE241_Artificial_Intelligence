Apple supplier Laird has warned annual profits will fall sharply following a sudden downturn in its smartphone components business and unprecedented pricing pressures. Shares in the group almost halved to 165p as it said it may be facing “a new reality” in the mobiles market after an expected pick-up in smartphone production failed to materialise. Tony Quinlan, Laird chief executive, said the company was looking into whether there may be a permanent shift in the way the consumer devices market operates. “What we have to accept is that this might not be a one-off. It might be a new way of working. We’ve got to look more forensically at this stuff. “Are we looking at a sector that is reaching maturity? We don’t have the answers yet.” The profit warning comes at a difficult time for Samsung, one of Laird’s key customers. Last week Samsung suspended production and sales of its Galaxy Note 7 after devices caught fire. In a gloomy third-quarter trading update, Laird said it now expects underlying full-year pre-tax profit of around £50m. That compares with analysts’ expectations of £75m, and £73m profit in 2015. “This is not good news,” Quinlan said, “but we hope that once the dust settles people will see we have a specific challenge in one part of the business at a time when other parts continue to perform well.” He added pricing pressure during the third quarter had been “truly relentless”, and that it was taking a number of “self-help” measures to improve operations and stabilise the business.
