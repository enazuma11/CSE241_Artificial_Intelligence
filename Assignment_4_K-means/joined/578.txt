The latest film from the Dardenne brothers was screened in Cannes to a slightly muted reception. It has subsequently been edited down by seven minutes and is released in a new cut. But I am not convinced that it’s a better one. I was in the minority in that I found the Cannes version compellingly acted – particularly by Adèle Haenel in the central role of a doctor who becomes obsessed with finding the identity of a girl who is found dead near her practice – and propulsively plotted. On a second watch, the film’s most jarring elements seemed to be highlighted, perhaps due to the shorter running time. The main issue, in the grim, rubbish-strewn naturalism of the film, is Jérémie Renier’s overwrought performance and the abrupt third act reveal that he delivers.
