 Jürgen Klopp will revert to his strongest Liverpool side at Leicester City on Tuesday after resting key players for the FA Cup. The captain Jordan Henderson will return after sitting out the Cup tie against West Ham to rest his heel. Daniel Sturridge, Divock Origi, Philippe Coutinho and Martin Skrtel are set to return to training but will not be considered for the match against the Premier League leaders. Klopp has welcomed the summer arrival of Pep Guardiola as Manchester City’s manager and expects the Catalan to come to England “to win everything”. City confirmed the worst kept secret in football by announcing Guardiola has signed a three-year contract to join them when he leaves Bayern Munich. Klopp, who has already made the move from Bundesliga to Premier League after leaving Borussia Dortmund last season, admits there are no words he can offer to help Guardiola but has no doubt over the Spaniard’s ambitions. “I don’t have any advice. He is one of the best managers in the world, no doubt about this,” he said. “He had two big clubs where he has worked at and now he will do his job at Manchester City. “Pep won everything in Spain, nearly everything in Germany so I think he wants to win everything in England, that is clear. I know him but not well enough to know something about his real targets or reasons for coming here. “The rumour for a long time was Man City and Pep seemed to be good friends or something like this so now they come together in the summer. I think it is good for both of course. “At Bayern he has enough work to do but when he is here it will be a very warm welcome like I had when I came here.”
