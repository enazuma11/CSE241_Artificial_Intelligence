 The undead outbreak survival fantasy genre’s hold on game-makers shows no sign of ending, and it’s a theme that developer Techland returns to with Dying Light, four years after the studio created its charismatic but flawed zombie title Dead Island. Like its predecessor, Dying Light (pictured) is a first-person game presented as an open world devastated by an outbreak, charging the player with surviving, using crude weapons. This time, the protagonist is an undercover operative from beyond the infection zone. The action largely blends somewhat clunky parkour, panicked close-quarters combat and fetch quests spread across a vast, engrossing city loosely based on Istanbul. Within this, a day-and-night cycle changes the setting considerably, presenting alternating realms different in both atmosphere and gameplay style. While the scripting is cliched, glitches rip through generally impressive visuals and the missions’ pacing can feel protracted, the gameplay mechanics do complement an absorbing emphasis on survival through evasion. Dying Light definitely doesn’t dazzle, then, and can feel unpleasantly dark, but it does enthral.
