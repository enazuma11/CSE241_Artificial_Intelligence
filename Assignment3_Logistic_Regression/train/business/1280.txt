Paula Nickolds, the new managing director of John Lewis, is a company “lifer” who was perhaps always destined for a senior role in retail management. Her father, Clive Nickolds, was a senior director at Marks & Spencer who once led its international operations, and as a child she would accompany him around the retailer’s stores on a Saturday. Nickolds has said she considered becoming a teacher after studying history at the University of Southampton, but instead she found herself following her father into retail, starting as a graduate trainee at John Lewis’s flagship Oxford Street store in 1994. She went on to hold buying roles in clothing and furniture before taking her first senior position as head of product development in 2006. During the economic downturn, between 2009 and 2013, she led the homewares buying teams where they developed the House and Croft collections.  Success there led to a promotion to overall buying and brand director where Nickolds had responsibility for the all-important Christmas ad, including 2013’s bear and the hare animation, before becoming commercial director last year, with responsibility for shops and product development. Nickolds is known for her calm demeanour, a rather different character to her predecessor as managing director, the hyperactive and fiery Andy Street.  She is popular within the partnership and seen as a down to earth “people person” with a keen sense of what the customer wants. A skill she will need to utilise in the tough economic climate ahead.
