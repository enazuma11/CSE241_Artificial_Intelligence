Strikes by Eurostar workers will be suspended from midnight to allow further talks, the Rail, Maritime and Transport (RMT) union said. Industrial action had started on Friday in a row over rosters and work-life balance at the cross-Channel train company.  Despite the strike by RMT train managers, which was due to continue for four days, Eurostar had only cancelled two trains on Friday and was expecting to run a full service on Saturday. Eurostar said all passengers booked to travel this weekend would be able to do so. A spokesman said earlier: “We are aware of strike action and our focus has been seeking a joint resolution whilst continuing to provide a good service for our customers.” About 80 train managers are involved in the dispute, but many such staff are in French unions and were not striking. The RMT also confirmed strike dates on Friday on Virgin Trains East Coast for the bank holiday weekend in a dispute over jobs. The union is also meeting Southern bosses for further talks after suspending strike action by conductors earlier this week.
