Sainsbury’s is to open mini-Habitat shops and more than double the number of Argos outlets in its supermarkets by Christmas after finalising its £1.4bn takeover of Home Retail Group. The supermarket said it would open 30 new Argos outlets, joining the 20 that have been trading for more than a year, as it kicks off the integration of its new acquisition.  Five Habitat concessions will also open in Sainsbury’s stores over the next few months. They will offer more than 600 products including furniture, lighting and homewares alongside Sainsbury’s existing home and cookware. Habitat pulled out of concessions in Homebase after that group was bought out by the Australian DIY operator Wesfarmers earlier this year. The last of the 84 concessions closed on Sunday. After completing the takeover on Friday, Sainsbury’s is now the UK’s biggest retailer of non-food, as well as the second biggest grocer, with 195,000 employees and more than 2,000 outlets including supermarkets, Argos stores, convenience stores and three flagship Habitat outlets. Mike Coupe, chief executive of Sainsbury’s, said: “This is the start of an exciting new phase for Sainsbury’s, Argos and Habitat. I am delighted to be able to quickly capitalise on the benefits of our combined group.” In documents released in July, Sainsbury’s suggested that between 200 and 300 store jobs would be eliminated by plans to relocate high street Argos branches to its supermarkets, although it said many staff would move over.  The retailer said up to 600 head office jobs were also at risk but it has insisted the takeover of Argos will ultimately create jobs because new Argos stores and supermarket collection points would be opened.  The group said it had no plans to close Home Retail Group’s head office in Milton Keynes or Sainsbury’s non-food management office in Coventry, although some functions may move between Milton Keynes and other Sainsbury’s office locations.
