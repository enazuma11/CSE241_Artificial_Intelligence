Sales of narrower beds and sofas are on the rise, reflecting the growing number of people in Britain squeezing into smaller living spaces, according to new figures. Homes in the UK are the smallest in Europe, with the average new build only 92% of the recommended size. As the government consults on setting a minimum bedroom size to crack down on rogue landlords who cram tenants into “rabbit hutch” homes, John Lewis says its shoppers are looking for ways to save space. Sales of small double beds, about 120cm (4ft) wide – 15cm less than traditional doubles – have jumped by 53% in a year, while sales of mini-sofas, known as snugglers, are up 12%.  Maggie Porteous, the director of shop trade at John Lewis, said its buyers and designers were constantly looking for space-saving ideas to meet demand. A full-length mirror with shelves slotted behind it, a coffee table that turns into a desk and the Samsung Serif TV, whose broad frame doubles as a mantelpiece for those with no space for the real thing, have all proved strong sellers in the past year, according to Porteous. There is clear evidence of the increasing importance of mobile phones in managing our lives. Not only did sales via smartphone on John Lewis’s website rise by 60% in the past year, but technology that links phones and homes grew too.  Sales of “connected home” items, such as smart TVs or the Nest technology that can send an alert if it detects unusual sounds, or adjust heating and lighting via a mobile phone app, were up 89% over the year. Home monitoring technology was up 265%. “It’s one of our fastest-growing categories,” said Porteous.  Among the products declining in popularity were alarm clocks, tablecloths and selfie sticks.
