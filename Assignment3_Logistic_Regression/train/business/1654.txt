Leading shares are on the rise again after a couple of days of uncertainty on concerns about the prospects for the UK once Brexit finally happens. But with Chinese inflation showing signs of picking up - a positive for the state of the country’s economy - mining shares are helping to push the leading index higher. So the FTSE 100 is currently up 40.10 points at 7017.84, albeit well below the record 7129 achieved earlier in the week. Rio Tinto has risen 59p to £26.35 following the Chinese data, while BHP Billiton is 23.5p better at 1207.5p, helped by analysts at Credit Suisse raising their target price from £11.50 to £13. But the biggest riser so far is Tesco, up 6.35p at 201.45p after settling the Marmite dispute with Unilever, down 27p at 3569.5p. Connor Campbell, financial analyst at Spreadex said: The abrupt end to Marmite-gate last night, with Tesco and Unilever coming to a price agreement, and a rebound from its mining stocks has allowed the UK index to climb back above the 7000 mark. The Eurozone indices were similarly robust in their gains this Friday, the DAX and CAC rising 0.8% and 1% respectively. But the pound has slipped back again on Brexit worries, down 0.5% at $1.2191. Elsewhere hedge fund group Man has jumped 15p to 123.7p after it reported strong third quarter figures, with quarterly funds under management up 6%. It also announced the purchase of asset manager Aalto, as well as a proposed $100m share buyback. In a buy note, Liberum said: Man Group is a long way from firing on all cylinders and arguably the time to buy it is in anticipation of that. We are not suggesting that is going to happen immediately but after recent share price weakness (-28% in last 6 months) we believe there is enough in today’s statement to reignite interest. Assets under management progress is broadly in-line, there is an interesting bolt-on acquisition and also the launch of a $100m share repurchase should all ensure the shares head towards our target price of 125p.
