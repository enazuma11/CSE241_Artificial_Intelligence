Leading shares have recovered some of their early losses but are still in negative territory, mainly due to the number of companies going ex-dividend. But Old Mutual is down sharply - 11p lower at 214.5p - after disappointing results, which saw a 9% drop in first half operating profit to £709m. This was well below the £769m expected by analysts. It also warned of an uncertain environment in its three key markets of South Africa, the UK and US. The insurer plans to split into four businesses, and hopes to complete the move by the end of 2018. Analysts at UBS said: Adjusted operating profit came in well behind our and consensus’ estimates, driven by significantly weaker UK Wealth Management earnings than expected form both the “invest and grow” businesses (£90m versus UBS estimate £121m) and a higher charge to the heritage book than we had expected for changes to exit penalties on those products. Elsewhere a smattering of takeover talk has enlived a relatively quiet market. Shire, fresh from completing its £22bn takeover of US group Baxalta, is now said to have its sights on Massachusetts-based drugs developer Radius Health. Shire was rumoured to be looking at Radius last year, possibly as a fall back if the Baxalta deal fell through. Now traders are hearing reports that it could be looking at a $70 a share offer for Radius, valuing the business at around $3bn (£2.3bn). Other potential bidders for Radius are said to include Pfizer, Amgen and Eli Lilley. Shire shares are currently 5p lower at £50.70. Overall the FTSE 100 is down 17.62 points at 6848.80, but around 37 points of that is due to ex-dividends.
