All 35 remaining BHS department stores are to be closed permanently this week, as the shop’s 88-year-long reign on the British high street comes to an end. If you’ve ever worked for the store, we’d like you to share your memories, photographs and experiences. The department store’s collapse in April, has affected 11,000 jobs, 22,000 pensions, and left Philip Green facing a criminal investigation.  Much of the 11,000-strong workforce were employed at concessions within BHS stores, but only 1,000 of these employees will be offered positions elsewhere within the Arcadia group. We’d like you to help tell the story of BHS. Perhaps you worked for the store and retired? Or maybe you’re part of the recent lay off? We’d like to know how BHS impacted your life whether recently or before its demise.  You can share your experiences in the form below – anonymously if you prefer – and we’ll use a selection in our reporting. You can share photographs with us via GuardianWitness by clicking on the blue button at the top of this article.
