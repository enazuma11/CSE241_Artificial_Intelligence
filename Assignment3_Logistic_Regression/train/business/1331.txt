Shares in Britain’s housebuilders have been lifted by better than expected results from Bellway. The company - which builds around half of its homes in London and the south - reported a 41% jump in full year profits to £498m and said demand remained strong despite the uncertainty after the EU referendum. Chairman John Watson said: The long term outlook continues to be positive...Whilst there is some uncertainty following the result of the EU referendum, trading since that date has remained resilient. But it warned that some suppliers were expected to seek price rises in the wake of the slump in the pound following the Brexit vote. Chief executive Ted Ayres told Reuters: I’m sure we’re going to have what we would call some sort of Unilever moments with some of our suppliers. The only people who have mooted price increases are structural timber [companies] and that’s obviously because of the exchange rate, and they’re mooting price increases of probably up to 10%. Analyst Chris Millington at Numis said: Bellway’s 2016 results are slightly above our estimates, but at this early stage of the year we are only upgrading 2017 marginally - but think the risk is firmly on the upside if current market conditions persist. Current trading trends have been robust since period end with Bellway selling 9% more houses per week than the equivalent period last year. Whilst economic uncertainty persists, we think the valuation of Bellway (and the wider sector) fails to reflect the strength of support provided by the Help to Buy scheme and the fact Bellway and the wider sector have very strong balance sheets. So Bellway shares are 28p better at £22.78, while the rest of the sector is also gaining ground. Persimmon has put on 13p to £16.77 while Barratt Developments is up 3p at 471.7p and Taylor Wimpey has added 1p to 143.4p.
