EasyJet pilots are being balloted for industrial action over claims of rising levels of fatigue.  Members of the British Airline Pilots Association (Balpa) will vote over the next few weeks, with the result due on 21 September.  A spokesman for the union said: “No plans have been made for what will happen beyond that date and any such reports are wrong. Balpa will issue further information after the close of the ballot.” An easyJet spokesman said: “EasyJet can reassure its passengers that no industrial action is currently planned by its UK pilots. “Although Balpa has informed us they are balloting their members, easyJet and Balpa continue to work together, as we are both committed to finding a resolution to the issues raised and we still hope to reach a mutually agreeable solution.”
