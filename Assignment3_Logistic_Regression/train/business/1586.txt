The sun shone. London was a magnet for overseas tourists taking advantage of the weak pound. UK consumers splashed the cash. Retailers shrugged off the post-Brexit vote blues. That, simply, was the message from the latest CBI snapshot of high street and online spending. Retailers had a much better August than they were expecting, with solid year-on-year growth in business. Sales were considered to be above average for the time of year even before the chance for an Olympics feelgood factor to have an impact. The CBI did its fieldwork in the two weeks that ended on 12 August, before Team GB’s gold rush. That said, the CBI’s distributive trades survey has to be treated with some caution. The sample size is small – 58 retailers – and the correlation with the official figures for retail sales has tended to be poor. In July, for example, the CBI reported a sharp drop in high street spending. The gap between those retailers saying spending was higher than a year earlier and those saying it was lower stood at -14 percentage points. The Office for National Statistics reported a 1.4% increase in retail sales in July, which seemed to chime better with the upbeat trading statements from individual retailers. There are two plausible ways of interpreting what is happening to spending. One view is that record employment, rising real incomes and the lowest interest rates in history will keep the economy humming and soon make Brexit a distant memory. An alternative take is that consumer spending growth will ease back as firms respond to increased uncertainty by laying off staff, and the rising inflation caused by dearer imports adversely affects living standards.  But none of the evidence so far available – whether from the ONS, surveys or retailers – is consistent with a third notion: that the shock of the referendum would send the economy spiralling straight into recession. If there is to be a Brexit effect, it will be more slow puncture than car crash.
