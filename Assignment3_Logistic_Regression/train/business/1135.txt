BT is seeking a new voice for its speaking clock in a competition being held to mark the 80th anniversary of the British dial-the-time service. The winner will be only the fifth person to voice the announcement of the time “at the third stroke” to the 12 million people in Britain who dial 123 each year.  Brighton native Sara Mendes da Costa has been the voice of the speaking clock since winning the last competition in 2007. Previous voices have included an actor and a London telephone exchange supervisor.  But time is against anyone with hopes of being the new voice – entrants have just a week to get their applications in before the competition closes at 10pm on Monday 29 August. To celebrate the 80th birthday, BT is donating the original speaking clock machines from 1936 and 1963 to the British Horological Institute.  David Hay, head of BT heritage, said: “80 years ago, BT’s technology created the speaking clock and it remains a much-loved part of British life today.  “Celebrating in this way demonstrates BT’s determination to preserve the heritage of the world’s oldest communications company on behalf of the nation.”  The competition is being run in partnership with BBC1’s The One Show, with the winner to be announced in November.
