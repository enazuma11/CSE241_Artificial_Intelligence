Manufacturers are enjoying a “delayed recovery” with increased output and orders and optimism for jobs, according to a report published on Monday. The manufacturers’ organisation the EEF said the sector was now regaining ground after a “sluggish” 18 months. Despite the improvement in conditions, the EEF said it was still forecasting that manufacturing will contract in 2017.  It also pointed to inflationary pressures building and “significant” price rises in the pipeline, a factor likely to weigh down on domestic activity in the year ahead.  Profit margins are also under considerable pressure and are likely to be squeezed further in 2017.  EEF chief economist, Lee Hopley said: “This is the most upbeat reading on the state of manufacturing we’ve seen for some 18 months and signals the start of brightening conditions, which had been briefly knocked off course following the referendum. “This anticipated turnaround can be attributed to a range of factors including the resilience, thus far, of the UK economy but also the strengthening of demand in a number of major markets. Critically, this should spur some new investment and recruitment activity to fulfil new customer demands.”  A survey of almost 400 firms showed the majority of manufacturing sectors and regions reported being more positive in the past three months compared with the previous quarter.
