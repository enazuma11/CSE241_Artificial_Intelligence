A planned Southern rail strike that would have happened close to Remembrance Day has been suspended following a request from the British Legion. Members of the Rail, Maritime and Transport workers’ union (RMT) were due to walk out from 3 to 5 November amid a bitter dispute over changes to the role of conductors. The union said it had suspended the strike on 3 November after being contacted by the armed forces charity.  However, walkouts planned for 4 and 5 November are due to go ahead, as will action on 22 and 23 November, and 6 to 8 December. The RMT’s general secretary, Mick Cash, said the decision regarding 3 November was made “after close consideration and following a personal request from the British Legion. The union recognises the very special importance of that particular day and as a result has decided to suspend the action. The rest of the scheduled action goes ahead as planned.”
