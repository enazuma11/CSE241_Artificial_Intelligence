BHP Billiton has reported a record full year loss of US$6.39bn (A$8.29bn) as heavy writedowns and significantly weaker commodities prices hurt its bottom line. Underlying profit for the year to 30 June was down 81% from a year ago to $1.22bn, as lower commodity prices cut $10.7bn in earnings, the company said. The results were slightly better than analyst expectations of a $7bn net loss and underlying profit of around $1bn. “The last 12 months have been challenging for both BHP Billiton and the resources industry,” chief executive Andrew Mackenzie said. “While commodity prices are expected to remain low and volatile in the short to medium term, we are confident in the long-term outlook for our commodities, particularly oil and copper.” The slide comes on the back of a massive $7.2bn writedown in the value of its US shale assets in January, after oil prices slid to their lowest level in more than a decade. The company will also make a provision of up to $1.3bn related to the costs of the Samarco mine dam disaster in Brazil, which killed at least 19 people and polluted a major river valley. BHP said unit cash costs across the group declined 16%. It expects to deliver another $1.8bn through productivity gains in the current financial year. BHP declared a final dividend of 14 US cents a share, down from 62 US cents a year ago, but in line with its new dividend policy of paying a minimum 50% of underlying profit. Before the results announcement, BHP shares in Australian trading closed nine cents, or 0.45% higher, at A$20.25 each.
