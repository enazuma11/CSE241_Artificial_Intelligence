SSE, one of Britain’s “big six” energy suppliers, has frozen its standard prices this winter, putting pressure on its rivals to do the same.  British wholesale gas and electricity prices have risen about 30% and 40% respectively since June, along with a bounceback in other commodities such as coal, leading to speculation that some electricity suppliers could raise prices.  “We understand that the prospect of increasing bills during the colder months is a real concern for customers, particularly as they start to turn up the heating,” Will Morris, SSE’s managing director of retail, said.  The company said prices would not rise until April 2017 at the earliest.  The move puts pressure on rivals Iberdrola’s Scottish Power, Centrica’s British Gas, RWE’s npower, EON and EDF Energy to do the same. Energy bills have doubled in Britain over the past decade to about £1,200 a year, and the government has said it could intervene in the market if it believes prices are too high. Commenting on today’s SSE price freeze, Stephen Murray, energy expert at MoneySuperMarket, said: “This is good news but customers shouldn’t be lulled into a false sense of security. Customers who are on a big six standard tariff are still paying £200 per year more than the cheapest tariffs on the market, many of which are fixed for one year or more. ”
