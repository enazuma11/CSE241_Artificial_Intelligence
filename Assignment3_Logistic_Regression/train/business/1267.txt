Shares in the building materials company SIG dropped almost a quarter to a four-year low after the firm issued a profits warning and said its chief executive was leaving immediately with up to a year’s money. Investors took fright as the company warned that trading had been weaker than expected following the EU referendum, with a “distinct slowdown” in its traditionally strongest months of September and October. The company was the biggest faller on the FTSE 250 as it warned full-year profits were now expected at between £75m and £80m, lower than the £90m City analysts had been forecasting.  The company said: “Following a slowing of activity around the time of the EU referendum, trading conditions in the UK have continued to soften and competition in the market has intensified.” It said the group had been hit by delays to some projects in the commercial sector and weak demand for specialist insulation among petrochemicals and manufacturing customers. The company, which supplies insulation, roofing, commercial interiors and other building products, said it would be closing about 20 to 30 branches and cutting some jobs to reduce costs. The chief executive, Stuart Mitchell, is leaving by “mutual agreement with immediate effect”. Leslie Van de Walle, chairman, said that at a time when the business was under pressure, they “needed a way to accelerate opportunities” under new leadership. A spokesman confirmed that Mitchell was entitled to receive a payoff of up to £558,250, representing his annual salary. But the exact amount would depend on whether he stepped into a new role elsewhere.  Mel Ewell, a non-executive director, is standing in as chief executive while the board finds Mitchell’s permanent replacement.  In its trading update for July to October, SIG said like-for-like sales fell by 1.1% in the UK and Ireland, and by 0.5% in mainland Europe.
