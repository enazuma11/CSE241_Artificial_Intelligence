A 24-hour strike on Virgin Trains East Coast is to go ahead after talks failed to resolve a dispute over jobs and conditions. Members of the Rail, Maritime and Transport workers’ union (RMT) will walk out on Monday. Virgin has said that services will not be affected. Mick Cash, the RMT’s general secretary, said: “RMT will not sit back while nearly 200 members’ jobs are under threat and while conditions and safety are put at risk by a franchise which is clearly in financial trouble.  “We will also not tolerate the cavalier attitude to safety that is now on show as the company mobilises its scab army of managers.” A Virgin Trains spokesman said: “We are running a full timetable on Monday and look forward to welcoming our customers on board.  “The safety of our customers is paramount and every train will be dispatched by a trained manager. We would not run a normal service if it, in any way, put our customers at risk.”
