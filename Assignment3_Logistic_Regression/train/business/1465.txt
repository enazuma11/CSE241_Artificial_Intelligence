Woolworths has slipped to a $1.23bn full-year loss after a big decline in earnings from its Australian food and drink business and more than $2.6bn of writedowns. The supermarket giant slashed its final dividend after slipping from last year’s $2.15bn profit on $2.63bn of writedowns, mostly related to its ongoing exit from the hardware sector and its underperforming Big W stores. The drop was compounded by a 40.8% decline in underlying earnings before interest and tax from Australian food and petrol to $1.76bn for the 52 weeks to 26 June. “Sales improved over the year for our Australian food business with comparable sales in the fourth quarter the strongest for the year driven by strong comparable transaction growth,” Woolworths’ chief executive, Brad Banducci, said. “However, underlying earnings from Australian food and petrol were down 40.8% on last year, reflecting lower sales growth driven primarily by our investment in lower prices and a decline in items per basket.” Woolworths, which slashed its dividend from 72c a year ago to 33c, made $1.87bn of writedowns against its failed hardware businesses, which it will be rid of by December. On Wednesday it said it had agreed to sell its Home Timber & Hardware business to Metcash for $165m by October, and would close all its Masters stores by early December.
