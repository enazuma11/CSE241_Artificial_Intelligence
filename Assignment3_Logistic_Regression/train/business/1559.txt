Asda has apologised to customers after a problem with its card machines led to long queues at checkouts across the country. The supermarket chain said it had resolved the issue in the majority of its stores after scores of shoppers took to social media to complain about the delays.  People posted photos of cashiers using old-fashioned card-readers, while others said stores were only accepting cash.  Gordon Carr from Gateshead tweeted: Thanks very much @asda I have lost my 'extra' hour today waiting at Boldon store as tills stopped working! 45 minutes with no explanation. Jim Bentley tweeted:  .@asda no backup, no redundancy system. We're just stood here like cattle waiting for your systems to start working again. On Sunday. pic.twitter.com/y6syzj8ycs Graeme Barbour wrote:  Seems to be technical issue at #Basingstoke @asda - no tills taking card payments, only cash. Customers requested to draw cash from ATM. An Asda spokeswoman said: “We are in the process of resolving a technical issue with our card payment system in stores. We’re continuing to process payments as quickly as we can but apologise to our customers for the inconvenience this has caused.” We’re aware of an issue with our store’s accepting card payments & are working to fix it asap, we’re sorry for any inconvenience caused :(
