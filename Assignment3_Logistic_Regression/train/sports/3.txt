 Mushtaq Ahmed will coach Sussex as well as England's spin bowlers for three months next summer. Sussex, who verbally agreed the deal with Mushtaq last October, today confirmed the availability of their record-breaking former leg-spinner following the conclusion of new work permit regulations. Mushtaq, whose stint with Sussex and England will begin in June, is delighted to be returning to help the county with whom he enjoyed such success as a player. "It's a great honour to come back to my 'family'," said the former Pakistan Test bowler. "It will be nice to see all my friends again and I hope I will be able to take my performances from the field into the dressing room. When you have a passion for something, you allow yourself to give your best - and I have the passion and desire for coaching. It is also a great honour to be working with the ECB, and I am looking forward to passing on my experience to the spinners of England as well as the whole Sussex squad." Sussex's professional cricket manager Mark Robinson is looking forward to working again with 38-year-old Mushtaq, whose playing days ended last summer following a recurrence of a knee injury. Robinson said: "The confirmation of Mushtaq's signing for the summer comes as great news to the club, especially after the intricacies of the new work permit regulations in the UK. "We worked closely with Mushtaq and the ECB in October to make sure the deal went ahead. It is great to have a man of Mushy's experience and stature to be working with the squad in what promises to be another exciting year of cricket at Hove."
