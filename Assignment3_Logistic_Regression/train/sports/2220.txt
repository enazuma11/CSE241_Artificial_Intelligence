 Unseeded Argentinian Gaston Gaudio claimed the prized scalp of former world No1 Lleyton Hewitt to march into the French Open semi-finals today. Gaudio joined compatriot Guillermo Coria - who will play British No1 Tim Henman on Friday - in the final four by racing to a 6-3, 6-2, 6-2 victory against the 12th seed in just under two hours. After taking through the first set 6-3 in 39 minutes, 25-year-old Gaudio broke Hewitt twice in the second set, which he sealed when the Australian netted with a forehand.  Hewitt was broken at the outset of the third set and from that point there was no way back, with Gaudio shrugging off a heavy fall in the second game to breeze past the former US Open and Wimbledon champion.  Although he bled at one stage from the injury which followed his fall, medics patched up Gaudio and he was able to cruise through.  Hewitt blasted a forehand wide on match point as Gaudio booked a ticket to the first grand slam semi-final of his career. In it he will meet David Nalbandian, who curtailed Gustavo Kuerten's bid for a fourth French Open title with a 6-2, 3-6, 6-4, 7-6 (8-6) victory. Nalbandian snatched the first set with an ace after 40 minutes of play before Kuerten fought back in the second with some of his best shots to level the match at one set all. In the third, the Brazilian then battled back from a 4-1 deficit to level 4-4, but Nalbandian held his nerve and won his game before taking advantage of Kuerten's fall on the red clay to claim a 6-4 win. Kuerten once again fought back and took control of the fourth set with a 3-1 advantage. But though he twice served for the set, Kuerten was unable to ram home the advantage and Nalbandian forced a tie-break, in which he eventually sealed a compelling match. "It was a tough time for me but I am surprised at my performance at Roland Garros this year," Kuerten said. "Nalbandian made me run a lot today, I suffered, but the crowd's support gave me the strength to fight although it was not enough."
