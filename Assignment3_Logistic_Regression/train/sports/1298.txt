 It was touch and go whether Lindsay Davenport would win her first match here since holding that championship point in the final three years ago against Venus Williams. Indeed at one stage it seemed touch and go whether she would finish at all. The former world No1 squeezed through against an opponent making her main-draw debut, Renata Voracova. But for all the courage, enthusiasm, and knowhow Davenport displayed during her 6-3, 5-7, 6-3 win over the Czech, her comeback is proving problematic. "I never thought I would be the player with a baby at 32 still trying to play," she admitted last week. But the birth was so good, the baby so well behaved, and a six-week training stint so encouraging that she has been bursting to compete again. Until, that is, her right knee began suffering strange twinges last week, causing her to withdraw from Eastbourne. A fearsome run of four games got Davenport the first set, and all went well till she reached set point at 5-4 in the second. Then the Czech played a solid rally to avert the danger and the set slipped away. During a long injury break between sets speculation reignited about the American's ability to continue, or at least contend. As Voracova broke back to 3-4 in the decider, an upset seemed possible. But the Czech double-faulted to drop serve for 3-5, and Davenport closed out the match with two aces and a first-service winner. This will be tougher than she thought.
