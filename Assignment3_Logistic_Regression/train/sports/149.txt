 England’s winter Test tour of India will begin in Rajkot in early November and end in Chennai just before Christmas. The England and Wales Cricket Board has jointly published a six-week schedule of five Tests, with its India counterparts, and one of three one-day internationals and three Twenty20s in January and February. Alastair Cook’s Test team will begin their campaign in Rajkot on 9 November, with matches starting on 17 November in Vizag, 26 November in Mohali, 8 December in Mumbai and 16 December in Chennai. Eoin Morgan’s white-ball teams will travel out to India for their six matches in the new year, starting with the first of two warm-ups in Mumbai on 10 January. “This promises to be a historic Test series, the first five-Test rubber England have played in India since 1984-85 and a great opportunity for Alastair Cook and his players to repeat the memorable Test series win we enjoyed on our last trip to India in 2012,” Andrew Strauss said. The ECB director added: “Equally, Eoin Morgan’s white-ball squad will be anticipating hard-fought and competitive encounters against high-quality opposition in both formats, with the one-day series providing excellent preparation for the ICC Champions Trophy to come at home later in the summer of 2017.” Tests 9-13 Nov first Test, Rajkot 17-21 Nov second Test, Vishakapatnam 26-30 Nov third Test, Mohali 8-12 Dec fourth Test, Mumbai 16-20 Dec fifth Test, Chennai ODIs 10 Jan warm-up match, Mumbai 12 Jan warm up match, Mumbai 15 Jan first ODI, Pune 19 Jan second ODI, Cuttack 22 Jan third ODI, Kolkata T20s 26 Jan first T20, Kanpur 29 Jan second T20, Nagpur 1 Feb third T20, Bangalore
