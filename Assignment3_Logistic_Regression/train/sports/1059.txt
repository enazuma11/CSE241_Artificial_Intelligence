 Andy Murray very nearly christened the new Australian Open surface yesterday, though not perhaps in the way the organisers of the Kooyong Classic warm-up event would have wanted. The Scot's match against Marat Safin was so hastily rescheduled that his lunch had not been fully digested when he started running around on the fancy new Plexicushion court. Lunch very nearly reappeared. "In some of the longer rallies I thought it was all going to come back up," said Murray, whose match against the Russian was moved up when David Nalbandian pulled out. "I felt a couple of times that it was all getting ready." His dyspepsia did little for the standard of his play and he lost 6-1, 6-4 in a glorified (and well-paid) practice match - the Classic is a round-robin exhibition event to give selected players a run-out in match conditions before the Australian Open, which starts on Monday. The bonus this year is that it gives players a taste of the new surface to be used at Melbourne Park as Kooyong, once a venue for the year's first grand slam when played on grass, has also had its courts relaid with Plexicushion. Plexicushion is very different in look - it comes in two shades of garish blue - and in feel to green Rebound Ace, the surface on which Murray won the Qatar Open last weekend. He does not approve of the decision to abandon Rebound Ace - an idiosyncratic surface found in very few places outside Australia - in favour of a more conventional, American-style hardcourt. "The one thing that's special about the slams is that all the courts should be different," is his view. "Rebound Ace was always high-bounce, a different surface to move on from a regular hardcourt. Now it's kind of just similar to the US Open, which I don't like as much. That's what I think a grand slam is all about. Each one is a different test of your game. You need to be able to adapt to all the surfaces."
