 Andy Murray has abandoned plans to work on his fitness with the American trainer Mark Grabow this week, the last before the US Open, because he is exhausted after 14 matches in 17 days on the North American hardcourt circuit. Murray's preparations for the first grand slam in which he has been seeded has thus suffered a blow even though the cause of the setback has been an outstanding competitive build-up which exceeded most hopes. As a result the 19-year-old Scot is now a top-20 player for the first time and arguably the most dangerously improving young player in the world, with hugely bolstered confidence. But placing further loads on a body that is already at a low ebb and has suffered ankle, neck and back injuries in recent months has been ruled out. "He's dead tired and he's going to need two or three days off because he's so exhausted," said Murray's coach Brad Gilbert, quite possibly understating the situation after flying with him to meet Grabow at Nick Bollettieri's academy in Florida. "He'll hit for a couple of days and then come to New York. Mark was worried that Andy's very tired and that's when you risk getting injured." Murray will now team up with Grabow, who has worked with Monica Seles, Jennifer Capriati and many professional football and basketball players, after the US Open which finishes on September 10. The plan is to work for 10 days at Gilbert's home near San Francisco with a more extended session in the off-season in December. Grabow will design a long-term work programme for Murray, which may include shorter training top-ups during the tour when they can be fitted in. The evidence of the past three weeks is that if Murray can add strength and stamina to a wonderfully varied and outstanding all-round game, he has every chance of pushing into the world's top 10.
