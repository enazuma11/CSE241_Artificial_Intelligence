With the new football season just weeks away, we’d like to hear your optimistic predictions of what lies in store for your football team this year 
 Fans of underachieving football clubs will hopefully have dusted off the misery of last season by now. If you were one of the lucky few and your team had a successful 2015/16 campaign, the potential for more memorable moments this season might be a real reason for late summer optimism. You told us what went wrong last year, and now we’d like to know what will (hopefully!) go right for your football club this season. Having had a chance to look at the state of your team during pre-season friendlies and summer tours, what causes for optimism do you have for the season ahead? Maybe your club is preparing for life in the different division, or there’s been an exciting managerial change that has resulted in an influx of new hungry players? Or is an already genius-declared manager busy building your team to hit more dizzying heights this season?  Whether you think it will all go wrong again by the time your have your Christmas dinner, or hope this will be the season your team dominate the back pages for all the right reasons, share your pre-season hopes and expectations with us. We’ll use the best submissions to put together a club-by-club guide from the fans’ perspective ahead of kick-off in August.
