 Rafael Nadal's win at Wimbledon has forced bookmakers into some drastic changes to their US Open markets. The Spaniard, 9-2 a week ago, is now best at 5-2 (general) for the title at Flushing Meadows. Roger Federer's odds have gone in the opposite direction. The Swiss had been odds-on to win the last grand slam but is now freely available at 5-4. Nadal is the favourite to win Wimbledon next year at 13-8 (Blue Square and Sky Bet) with Federer 7-4 (Ladbrokes and VC Bet). The biggest British story at SW19 was Laura Robson's win in the girls' singles, which prompted Ladbrokes to offer 50-1 that she will win the senior event by 2020. Forty-eight hours later, that price fell to 6-1. Ladbrokes quotes Robson at 33-1 to win the title before her 20th birthday (in 2014) and 5-1 to do so at any time in her career.  Lewis Hamilton's win in the British grand prix saw the McLaren man's price tumble from 4-1 into 15-8 (Extrabet) to win the formula one drivers' title. With 48 points he is tied at the top of the standings with the 7-5 (Sporting Odds) favourite Kimi Raikkonen and 9-2 (Totesport) shot Felipe Massa. Ahead of the Open Championship the bookmakers have cut prices on the recent tour winners Ross Fisher (125-1 into 66-1, general) and Anthony Kim (80-1 into 50-1, general). Sergio Garcia is now a single-figure favourite with a dozen firms, although 10-1 is still freely available on the Spaniard.
