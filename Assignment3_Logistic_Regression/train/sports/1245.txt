 Andy Murray is hoping to add more power to his game, but has dismissed suggestions that he should look to base his style of play on Rafael Nadal. The 19-year-old Scot was due to play South Korea's Hyung-Taik Lee in the quarter-finals of the SAP Open in San Jose early this morning as he continued his defence of the title. A year on from that victory Murray said he was still looking to improve areas of his game, but while he admits that he is looking to bulk up, he denied that he should try to imitate Nadal's powerful baseline game. "Me and Nadal have completely different body types, so in terms of looking as bulky and thick as him probably not, but definitely [I hope to be] as strong. "I think [Roger] Federer is a good person for me to look at as he has big legs like me and was thin in his upper body when he was younger. I just want to put about eight or nine more pounds on, then I will be happy with that weight. "Just because you have bulk like that doesn't necessarily make you more efficient. If that was the case then I wouldn't be able to serve harder than Nadal. "It also depends how you determine strength. Is it how long you can last, how hard you can hit the ball, how big you can serve, how much weight you can lift, or who has more muscles?" The No1 seed, Andy Roddick, knocked out in the semi-finals by Murray last season, set up a meeting with Vincent Spadea after beating fellow American Sam Querrey, and the Croatian Ivo Karlovic was rewarded for his surprising victory over second seed James Blake with a match against Mardy Fish.
