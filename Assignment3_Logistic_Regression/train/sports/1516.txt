 Monty Panesar is to travel with Northamptonshire on their pre-season tour of Barbados as he continues his recovery from injury and tries to rebuild his career. The former England spinner has been a regular presence back around his old club this winter, but is not yet ready after shoulder surgery at the end of last year to bowl again in the middle. The 33-year-old’s troubles off the pitch and loss of form on it have been well-chronicled and after being released by Essex last season, he started the off-season by having an operation. Northamptonshire confirmed he will accompany their squad in the Caribbean, where they are scheduled to play matches against Barbados and Nottinghamshire. “As part of his ongoing rehabilitation, Monty Panesar will also be present in Barbados,” the club said. “Presently the rehab of his shoulder will prevent him from bowling in matches. “The tour will offer him the chance to maintain his rehab with [physio] Barry Goudriaan as well as share his experiences of top-level cricket with younger members of the playing squad at key times during the trip.” Panesar has no playing contract as yet with Northamptonshire. He began his professional career with Northants 15 years ago, before moving to Sussex in 2010 only to be released in September 2013 after being fined by police for his drunken behaviour on a night out in Brighton. A short spell back on loan at his first club followed for the left-arm spinner, who has taken 167 wickets in his 50 Tests, before he was signed by Essex. He played his final match for them against Surrey last August and with England’s scheduled Test trips to spin-friendly Bangladesh and India next winter promising the possibility at least of a way back into international cricket, Panesar could yet make a homecoming with Northants.
