 The American Adam Helfant has been appointed as the ATP's top man, taking over from South African Etienne de Villiers as executive chairman and president of the ruling body of men's professional tennis. A Harvard law graduate, Helfant was a senior executive with Nike for 12 years and spent three years with the National Hockey League as an attorney. De Villiers, appointed in 2005, was frequently criticised for not listening to the top professionals who now have the world's leading three players — Rafael Nadal, Roger Federer and Novak Djokovic — on the ATP's player council. One of Helfant's initial tasks will be to secure further sponsorship for the sport.
