 Kelechi Iheanacho believes nothing should be read into Manchester’s City’s humbling defeat by Southampton as they prepare for their return Champions League tie against Real Madrid. The teenage striker scored twice as City went down 4-2 at St Mary’s Stadium but is unlikely to be in the starting line-up on Wednesday after he was one of the eight changes Manuel Pellegrini made to the side who drew 0-0 in the first leg. Joe Hart, Nicolás Otamendi and Fernandinho stayed in the team but Vincent Kompany, Sergio Agüero and possibly Yaya Touré, who is back in training after a thigh strain, are likely to be leading the team at the Bernabéu. Asked whether being beaten by Saints would damage City’s confidence, Iheanacho said: “It is not a big blow because we have played now and we need to focus on the next game against Madrid so we put this game behind us. We lost quite well but we put it behind us and focus on Madrid and come back stronger.” He admitted it was not an ideal result but added: “This game is not good preparation for us but we will keep it behind us, focus and train and go to the Bernabéu and hope we qualify. “It shouldn’t be a distraction,” he said of the Saints game. “We need to keep it behind us and work hard in training and go there and fight for the final.” The Nigerian is likely to be on the bench as City aim to make the final for the first time with Agüero returning up front but at the moment he is content to simply be included in the squad. “It is a dream come true for me and I am happy if I go there and I hope we do well and there is a great atmosphere there. I haven’t been there before but I am happy to go there to get a win. “It is going to be a big challenge for us but we will keep our heads down and keep working hard to get there.” Was it his dream to get the winner at the Bernabéu? “Yeah if I play I need to work hard for the team and help them qualify for the finals if we get the goals.”
