 Mid-America is being battered by tornadoes, and yesterday a Dutchman named Martin Verkerk blew up his own little twister to send Andy Roddick, the No5 seed, spiralling to a 6-7, 6-3, 6-4 defeat in the second round of the Italian Open at the Foro Italico.  Verkerk, 24, won his first tournament in Milan this year and in many respects is a mirror image of the 20-year-old American. Both are tall, with immense serves, and neither possesses a backhand that can be relied upon under pressure. On this occasion Verkerk's ground strokes proved more reliable than those of Roddick, who won in straight sets when they met in the first round of the US Open last year. "It was tough. You expect the big serve from him but the way he played from the ground was especially impressive," said Roddick. The American, who was a semi-finalist here last year when he made his debut in the tournament, appeared to have wrested the initiative after taking the first-set tie-break 8-6 and then breaking Verkerk early in the second. "I played a bad game to let him back into it, and then he started playing a lot better," said Roddick, who this year reached the last four in the Australian Open after winning a five-hour quarter-final epic 21-19 in the fifth set against Morocco's Younes El Aynaoui. Switzerland's Roger Federer, again won stylishly, defeating Argentina's Mariano Zabaleta 7-6, 6-2, and in an all-Spanish match Juan Carlos Ferrero beat Alex Corretja 6-4, 6-4. In the last match of the evening session the unlikely pairing of Tim Henman and Brazil's Gustavo Kuerten defeated Massimo Bertolini and Giorgio Galimberti 7-5, 4-6, 6-0 in the first round of the doubles.
