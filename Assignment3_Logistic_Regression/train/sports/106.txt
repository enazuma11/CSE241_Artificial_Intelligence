 Michael Di Venuto yesterday boosted Derbyshire's chances of ending one of county cricket's least wanted statistics. The Tasmanian hit 90 in a total of 132 without loss before rain set in against Leicestershire at the County Ground, as Derby chased a first Championship home win since June 1, 2002.  Ian Harvey, 34, is to stay with Gloucestershire for the season. The Victorian had returned on an interim basis while the county waited for the New Zealanders Shane Bond and Hamish Marshall to arrive but, with Bond ruled out by a knee injury, the one-day specialist from Wonthaggi has agreed to stay on.
