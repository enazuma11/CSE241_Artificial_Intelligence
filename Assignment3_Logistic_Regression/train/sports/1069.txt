 Steven Martens has resigned as player director of the Lawn Tennis Association after four years working for the governing body. The Belgian will leave his post at some point over the next three months, in order to join the Royal Belgium Football Association as general secretary. Martens became an increasingly powerful figure, having initially joined the LTA as technical director in 2006. He was frequently the man tasked with defending the approach of the oft-maligned organisation. One of his major tasks was undertaking a review of men's tennis in Britain. His recommendations about keeping players in the game longer and talent identification have been incorporated into the LTA's strategy. The LTA chief executive, Roger Draper, said: "Thanks to the work that Steven and the team have done over the past four years, we now have the structures in place to identify, deliver and support talent in this country. Steven leaves with the very best wishes of the LTA." The LTA have yet to decide how or whether to replace Martens. He follows names such as Paul Annacone, Carl Maes, Bill Mountford, Peter Lundgren and Brad Gilbert in leaving the governing body since Draper was appointed in 2006.
