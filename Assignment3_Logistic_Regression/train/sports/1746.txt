 Sydney FC are furious at Football Federation Australia’s decision to hold the FFA Cup final at Melbourne City’s home ground, labelling it a “slap in the face” to their fans. Melbourne City scored a 2-0 win over cross-town rivals Victory on Tuesday night to book their place in the decider against the Sky Blues on 30 November at AAMI Park.  FFA boss David Gallop cited scheduling and maximising attendance for the call to hand home ground advantage to City, a call that was made before the semi-finals. “AAMI Park was selected to host the final to maximise attendance and broadcast numbers while ensuring the cup final is played in a venue that embodies the unique spirit of the competition,” Gallop said in a statement. But Sydney FC believe they had a stronger case to host the final, with their fans not being granted one home game during the club’s run to the trophy decider this season. Of the Sky Blues’ four FFA Cup ties, they’ve played in Wollongong, Perth, at Edensor Park in western Sydney and Canberra. “The FFA has got this decision completely wrong. It’s a slap in the face to all Sydney FC fans,” chairman Scott Barlow told News Corp Australia. “It was made purely to maximise the profit the FFA will make from the game.” Barlow said Melbourne hosting the 2015 final – when Melbourne Victory downed Perth Glory at AAMI Park in front of 15,000 people – meant it was Sydney’s turn. “The fact that last year’s grand final was also held in Melbourne was completely ignored,” he said. “The fact that we have the best record coming into this final was completely ignored. The fact that all five of our FFA Cup games will be away games was completely ignored – despite Melbourne City having three home games. Make no mistake, this decision was made by the FFA purely for commercial reasons. It is an unfair decision to our club.”
