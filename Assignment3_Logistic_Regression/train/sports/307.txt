 Pakistan's fast-bowling crisis worsened yesterday with the news that Rana Naved-ul-Hasan could join Shoaib Akhtar in missing most, if not all, of the four-Test series against England this summer.  Naved could have Gilmore's groin - more popularly known as a sportsman's hernia, for which England's left-arm spinner Ashley Giles recently underwent an operation. He suffered the injury bowling for Sussex and scans taken in England will now be couriered to the Pakistan Cricket Board's medical commission for assessment. Whether Pakistan opt for prolonged rest or an operation, he could face a minimum six-week lay-off, which would rule him out of at least the first two Tests. The loss of Naved is a huge blow for Pakistan. His skills in English conditions are proven, with 88 wickets in only 14 county matches for Sussex. His 34 wickets at 15.29 this summer have been a key component in Sussex's rise to the top of the championship.
