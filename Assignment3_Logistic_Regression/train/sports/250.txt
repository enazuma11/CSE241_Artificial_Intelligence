 Surrey have announced plans to increase the capacity of the Kia Oval, the venue of the final Ashes Test, by 1,300 at the end of the season. The redevelopment will cost Â£10m and will affect the Peter May and the Lock stands and is expected to be completed by next May. It will increase capacity to 25,300. The stand will continue to be named after May, who led Surrey to their sixth and seventh consecutive County Championships in 1957 and 1958 and also captained England from 1955 to 1961, winning the Ashes in 1956. Although the neighbouring Lock Stand is being demolished, the club is renaming the Laker Stand as the Lock/Laker Stand, continuing to honour the contribution made by the spin partnership of Tony Lock and Jim Laker, who collectively took 3,108 wickets for the club.
