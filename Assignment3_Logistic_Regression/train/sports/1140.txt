 Pete Sampras is out. The Swiss teenager Roger Federer has handed the champion his second Wimbedon loss in nine years, winning 7-6, 5-7, 6-4, 6-7, 7-5. The seven-time champion twice came back from a set down but eventually succumbed when Federer, a former Wimbledon junior champion, broke his service to 15 in the final game. It is the biggest shock of a day that also saw the No 5 seed Lleyton Hewitt beaten by Nicolas Escude. The Frenchman recovered from losing the first set to win in five, 4-6, 6-4, 6-3, 4-6, 6-4. And then there was one. In the battle of the unseeded big servers on court one Greg Rusedski lost in straight sets to Goran Ivanisevic - 7-6, 6-4, 6-4 - leaving Tim Henman as Britain's sole singles survivor. Only two games went against serve and Ivanisevic won both of them. He finished the match with his 22nd ace of the match. Henman has lost the first set to Todd Martin on centre court but is a break up in the second. He won the first game to 15 with a drop shot played behind his heel and broke Martin to take a 3-1 lead, but nothing much went right in the first set after that. The American broke back immediately and won the tie-break 7-3. Henman has had some trouble with his back. A trainer rubbed something on it after the sixth game and folded a towel over the back of the No 6 seed after the first set. Andre Agassi, the second-seeded American, has beaten Nicolas Kiefer, 6-3, 7-5, 7-5. He will meet Escude in the quarters. Earlier, Pat Rafter, last year's runner-up, dropped the first set to the unseeded Russian teenager Mikhail Youzhny before coming through in four sets.  Serena Williams beat the 12th-seeded Bulgarian Magdalena Maleeva 6-2, 6-1. Her first serve regularly hit 110mph and she took the match in just under 49 minutes. Venus Williams joined her sister in the quarter-finals by crushing the unseeded Russian Nadejda Petrova 6-2, 6-0. Justine Henin, the No 8 seed from Belgium, went a set down to Anke Huber but took the match 4-6, 6-2, 6-2.
