 Centuries from Lydia Greenway and Arran Brindle have powered England's women's team to a 62-run win over South Africa in Potchefstroom. England took a 1-0 lead in the three-match one-day international series after the pair's unbroken stand of 218 – the second-highest fourth-wicket partnership in women's ODIs – led them to 297 for three, and they bowled their hosts out for 235 in reply. Charlotte Edwards made just one on her 150th ODI appearance and her opening partner Danielle Wyatt fell for 21 to leave England 32 for two. A brisk 33 from Sarah Taylor built some momentum, but it was when Greenway and Brindle joined forces at 79 for three that the game went away from South Africa. Greenway made 125 not out from 127 deliveries, striking 12 boundaries, while Brindle found the rope 15 times in her unbeaten 107 from 102 balls. Greenway was quickly back in the action with a catch off Isa Guha to dismiss the South Africa opener Shandre Fritz and, although Trisha Chetty (72) and Alison Hodgkinson (71) put on 143 in 28 overs, Laura Marsh (two for 50) removed the former and the innings subsided from there. Wyatt and Danielle Hazell also took two wickets apiece. Greenway said: "We did quite a lot of running out there but it was great to come away with a win from our first game. It's taken quite a long time to get my ODI century so it's really nice to finally get it." Brindle added: "It's a great feeling scoring a hundred at any time, but to do it in an international and the first game of the tour is fantastic."
