 Barcelona closed in on the La Liga title by thrashing their local rivals Espanyol 5-0 on Sunday as Atlético Madrid dropped out of the race after losing 2-1 at Levante and Real Madrid beat Valencia 3-2. Barça top the standings on 88 points, Real moved into second on 87 and Atlético have 85 with one game remaining. Barcelona went ahead in the eighth minute when Lionel Messi curled a 22-yard free-kick into the top corner with a magnificent finish. Luis Suárez stretched the hosts’ lead with two goals in the second half before Rafinha and Neymar completed the rout. Atlético took the lead at Levante in the first minute through Fernando Torres, but the relegated home side fought back, equalising through Victor Casadesus before Giuseppe Rossi grabbed the winner in stoppage time. Real were without their goalkeeper Keylor Navas, the defender Dani Carvajal, the midfielder Luka Modric and the winger Gareth Bale through injury, but went ahead thanks to a thunderous low finish from Cristiano Ronaldo in the 26th minute. Karim Benzema scored the second before the break but Rodrigo Moreno, who was later sent off, pulled one back for Valencia after half‑time. Ronaldo added his second a few minutes later before André Gomes scored a sumptuous consolation goal for Valencia.
