 Anastasia Myskina, who last year said she would not play for Russia if Maria Sharapova were selected for her country's Fed Cup team, says she is stepping aside from the team to give other players a chance. Myskina's withdrawal may allow Sharapova to make her Russian team debut, but the 2004 French Open champion is upset about the implications being drawn from her announcement. "I've made it clear that I based my decision on it being impossible to repeat the experience of the last two amazing finals," said Myskina, who scored three wins when Russia made history by capturing the Fed Cup in Moscow. "We have so many good girls who can play and who want to play, so I just wish them good luck. I want to step aside now and let others have the chance." However, the reasons for Myskina's withdrawal were bound to be questioned after last year when she made abrasive remarks about Sharapova and her father, Yuri, who she said she could not stand. There is no doubt that Myskina's withdrawal could open a door for the sport's best-known player, whether or not this was a factor in Myskina's thinking. Moreover, it has coincided with remarks from Elena Dementieva, the heroine of Russia's Fed Cup defence in Paris last month, which make it clear that she is happy to play alongside Sharapova. "We have a very good tradition in Russia, which is that the best four players play," Dementieva said. "Sharapova can make a big difference and we can have a very solid team with her as well." But Dementieva also doubts that it will happen. "I think if she is going to play it will make our team even stronger. But I don't think she has such a desire because she didn't participate for two years. She has been telling the captain that she's gonna play but she's not [done so], so I don't think she wants to play." However, that does not tally with what the Siberian-born Sharapova, who has been based in America since she was nine, claims - that in her heart she is still Russian.
