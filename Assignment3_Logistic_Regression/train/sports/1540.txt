 England could play Test cricket in the United Arab Emirates for the first time as the Pakistan Cricket Board seeks a neutral venue for their 2012 series. Pakistan have been forced to play their home series on foreign soil since the gun attack on a Sri Lanka team bus before the Lahore Test in March last year. The Emirates Cricket Board chief executive Dilawar Mani revealed he has asked to host England's tour, which is scheduled to begin in January 2012 and include three Tests and five one-day internationals, as well as Sri Lanka's trip in October next year. "I've had a very brief discussion with the Pakistan Cricket Board management in this regard. Obviously the chairman is yet to give me a yes," Mani told the Gulf News. "I told them that if you look at Pakistan's home series according to the Future Tours Programme, they are to host Sri Lanka in October next year and England in early 2012. "Ideally if they could commit that to the EC [Emirates Cricket] now, then our facilities could be more prepared. "Everyone will benefit for we will have the time to sell sponsorships, commercialise the arrangements. "We can also ensure the grounds are there and take care of any shortcomings." The UAE is currently hosting Pakistan's "home" series against South Africa, which includes two Twenty20s, five ODIs and two Tests. The country's Abu Dhabi and Dubai stadia also hosted Pakistan's limited-overs series against England, Australia and New Zealand last year.
