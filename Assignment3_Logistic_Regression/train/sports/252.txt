 Pakistan fast bowler Shoaib Akhtar has lodged an appeal against the five-year ban imposed on him by the Pakistan Cricket Board for repeated breaches of its disciplinary code. "I have followed the procedures of the board. I have respect for the law, the board rules and the chairman," he said. PCB spokesman Shafqat Naghmi confirmed that the PCB's appellate committee had received Shoaib's appeal and would take up the matter on Monday. The board had announced on Tuesday that it was banning Akhtar from all domestic and international matches for a series of offences against its code of conduct. Akhtar immediately signified his intention to appeal and, if necessary, use the courts to get the decision reversed. He also accused board chairman Nasim Ashraf of victimising him and even trying to extort money from him and other members of the national team. The board responded with a 200 million rupees (£1.6 million) defamation action against Akhtar. In response, Akhtar said "I do respect the chairman of the PCB," but stopped short of the apology demanded by Ashraf. Akhtar, 32, was once the fastest bowler in cricket. But injuries as well as a series of disciplinary incidents have restricted him to a 46-Test career which is likely to be over if the ban is upheld. Earlier this year, Akhtar criticised the PCB for dropping him from its elite group of highly-paid players. He was already on probation after the board fined him and imposed a 13-match international ban for hitting fellow bowler Mohammad Asif with a bat before the Twenty20 World Cup in South Africa last year. The five-year ban will also prevent Akhtar playing in the lucrative Indian Premier League Twenty20 tournament which begins this month. Akhtar had been due to play with the Calcutta franchise on a contract worth $450,000 (£227,020) for one season, but the IPL management announced on Thursday that he will not be permitted to play in the league as long as the Pakistan ban stood.
