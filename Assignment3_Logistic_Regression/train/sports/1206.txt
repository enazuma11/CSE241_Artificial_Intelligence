 Beating the World's No1 doubles team is not easy, even for two players as rich in talent as Jamie Murray and Max Mirnyi, yet the Briton and his Belarussian partner are starting to make a habit of it. For the second time in five weeks, Murray and Mirnyi have beaten the Bryan brothers, the pre-eminent team on the ATP Tour. Twenty-nine-year-old twins Bob and Mike Bryan have been playing together since they were tiny boys, have ended four of the last five seasons as joint World No1s and have won five grand slam titles as a pairing as well as two Masters Cups. Murray and Mirnyi, on the other hand, only got together in January, and while Mirnyi is no stranger to winning major titles and 22-year-old Murray won the mixed doubles title at Wimbledon last year with Jelena Jankovic, their trophy haul as a partnership consists of one low-level ATP event in Delray Beach. That was won last month with defeat of the Bryans in the final, an achievement every bit as significant as winning their first title together and a feat matched by their 5-7, 6-4, 10-6 success over the Bryans in the quarter-finals of the Pacific Life Open last night. "It was so important to have won Delray, even though it's not a top tier tournament," said Mirnyi. "But to have beaten the Bryans in the final, that meant so much to both of us, and to the rest the field out there. We made a big statement."  A run to the semi-finals of a Masters Series event - Murray's first with any partner - is also a big step forward. Murray and Mirnyi are currently at 15 in the world team doubles rankings, but need to be among the top eight teams at the end of the year in order to qualify for the Masters Cup in Shanghai, something they have set as a goal along with moving up to be among the top eight seeds at the grand slams. If the world's top team cannot stop them, then it is hard to see who might.
