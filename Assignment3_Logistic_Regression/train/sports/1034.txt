 Alex Bogdanovic became the second member of the British Davis Cup squad to withdraw from a tournament this week.  Britain's No3 had to retire with a left shoulder problem in the Cherbourg challenger in France during the first set of his second-round match against South Africa's Rik de Voest. At the time he was losing 5-1.  Earlier this week Andrew Murray, 17, the US Open junior champion, returned from a Futures event in Portugal after the recurrence of a back injury.  Both players are members of the five-man squad, which also includes Greg Rusedski, Arvind Parmar and David Sherwood, for the Euro-African zonal tie against Israel in Tel Aviv starting next Friday.  "Both returned as a precaution and it is not thought either injury is serious," said a spokesperson for the LTA.
