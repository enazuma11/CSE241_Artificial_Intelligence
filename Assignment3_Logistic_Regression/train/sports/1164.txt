 Federico Luzzi has been banned from the ATP Tour for 200 days and fined $50,000 (Â£25,100) after being found guilty of gambling on matches. An ATP investigation launched as part of the governing body's anti-corruption programme found that the Italian, ranked 139 in the world, had "wagered 273 times on 836 tennis matches between May 2004 and April 2007".  Luzzi, 28, was found to have placed a bet on himself to win a match, although the ATP said he was not found to have made any attempt to "affect the outcome" of any match. Luzzi is the fifth unheralded Italian to fall foul of the ATP's investigation into betting and match-fixing. The most recent was Giorgio Galimberti, banned for 100 days and fined $35,000 last month.  The WTA Tour plans to fight corrupt betting by the creation of an information database, it emerged yesterday some 24 hours after a spectator was threatened with ejection from the Dubai Open. After being warned for sending a commentary on a match via his mobile, a man had his personal details taken before leaving the stadium. The action is part of what WTA Tour officials are now describing as a zero-tolerance policy. Yesterday here Svetlana Kuznetsova reached her second final of the year by defeating Jelena Jankovic 5-7, 6-4, 6-3. In an all-Russian final she will play Elena Dementieva, who beat Francesa Schiavone 5-7, 7-5, 6-2.
