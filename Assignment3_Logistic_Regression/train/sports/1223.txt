 The most eagerly awaited tennis rematch will be staged today between the world's two top-ranked players: Roger Federer and Rafael Nadal. In Dubai yesterday Federer reached his ninth successive final and extended his record winning streak on hard courts in the open era to 56 games by beating Mikhail Youzhny 6-3, 6-2. A comfortable victory over a Russian opponent who often beats him in practice gave Federer the chance of revenge against Nadal, who beat him nine months ago to win the French Open. They have not met since, and though the circumstances and timing favour the Swiss there has been enough encouragement for Nadal, in only his second tournament back after three months out with a foot injury, to believe he has a chance against the world No1. The 19-year-old Spaniard showed during his 6-4, 6-2 win over Rainer Sch√ºttler that his movement is back close to its exceptional best and that his ground strokes have developed a better rhythm. Asked the key to victory Nadal replied: "If Federer doesn't play his best."
