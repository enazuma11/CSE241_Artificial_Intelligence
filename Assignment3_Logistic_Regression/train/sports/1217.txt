 Former champion Lleyton Hewitt came through a rain-interrupted match against Argentine Guillermo Canas to reach the fourth round. "That's the longest and toughest rain-delayed match I've ever played in," said Hewitt, who finally won through 6-4, 3-6, 6-3, 6-4 after his match was held over from yesterday. "It was a mental battle more than anything but I felt like I handled it pretty well." The 16th seed will play either Novak Djokovic or Nicolas Kiefer in the last 16. Roger Federer's quarter-final opponent will be Juan Carlos Ferrero after the Spanish 20th seed beat Janko Tipsarevic in straight sets. It is the first time former world No1 Ferrero has reached the last eight at Wimbledon. "I feel that I'm playing good right now," said Ferrero, who was impressive in beating the Serb 7-5, 6-3, 7-6. The former French Open champion said he would do what he could to unsettle Federer. "I know it's difficult because he has such a good record here, but I have nothing to lose." Second seed Rafael Nadal was frustrated by the weather for a second successive day in his match with Sweden's Robin Soderling. Fewer than six games were played in their clash on Court One, with the game evenly poised at 4-4 in the fifth and deciding set.  Third seed Andy Roddick also suffered delays, winning the first set 6-2 against France's Paul-Henri Mathieu before he was held up by the weather at 6-5 in the second.  Elsewhere, Nikolay Davydenko beat promising French youngster Gael Monfils in straight sets in their delayed third-round match. The Russian sixth seed will play 10th seed Marcos Baghdatis for a place in the quarter-finals after his 6-3, 7-5, 6-3 victory.
