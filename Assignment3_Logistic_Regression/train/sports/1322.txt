 Guillermo Coria won the title here yesterday, crushing Rainer Schüttler 6-2, 6-1, 6-3, to establish himself as the favourite for the French Open.  The 22-year-old Argentinian is neither a big hitter nor server but has wonderful control on this surface - and infinite patience. Schüttler, who had come to this tournament with only two Tour wins this year, could find no way past the world No4 who extended his run of victories on clay to 26.  Tim Henman   pleased himself hugely by winning the doubles, along with Nenad Zimonjic of Serbia, the scratch pairing beating Gaston Etlis and Martin Rodriguez of Argentina 7-5, 6-2. Five years ago Henman also won the doubles here with the Frenchman Olivier Delaitre.  His right shoulder, which had troubled him before and after his singles exit on Friday against Schüttler, was "back to normal" by Saturday's doubles semi-final. Henman will now concentrate on gym work for a few days before the Italian Open which begins next Monday.
