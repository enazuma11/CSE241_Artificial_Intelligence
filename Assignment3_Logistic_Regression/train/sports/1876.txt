 Southampton have swiftly added to their squad following Graziano Pellè’s departure to China, with the south-coast club announcing the signing of midfielder Pierre-Emile Hojbjerg from Bayern Munich. The Denmark international has joined the Saints on a five-year deal for an undisclosed fee. Pellè completed his move from Southampton to the Chinese club Shandong Luneng for an undisclosed fee though recent reports had put the striker’s fee at £13m. The Italy striker had a further year remaining on his contract at Southampton, who were believed to have been reluctant to offer an extension. He is expected to earn £34m over the next two-and-a-half years. A statement from the club read: “Everyone at Southampton would like to thank Graziano for his efforts during his time at St Mary’s and wish him well for the future.” Pellè, who turns 31 on Friday, moved to St Mary’s from Feyenoord in the summer of 2014, making 81 appearances for the south coast club and scoring 30 goals before going on to lead the Italy front line at the European Championship this summer. The player scored twice in France, against Belgium in the group stage and in the round of 16 against Spain, with both scored in injury time to seal 2-0 victories for his country. Pellè is understood to have been eyeing a move to China since January, hence Southampton’s purchase of Charlie Austin from Queens Park Rangers. He will link up with the former Newcastle United forward Papiss Cissé at the Chinese Super League club.
