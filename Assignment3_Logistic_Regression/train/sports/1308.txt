 When Ana Ivanovic won her first grand slam title here last year, defeating in the final the current world No1, Dinara Safina of Russia, it appeared that it would be the precursor to many more. Since then, though, the Serb, pictured below, has failed to progress beyond the third round of the three slams and has won only one title, slipping down the rankings from the pinnacle to No8. Various setbacks, including a particularly problematicthumb injury last year and now a sore right knee, on which she wears strapping support,have sapped her confidence and so far Craig Kardon, her new American coach who made his name with Martina Navratilova, has not had a huge impact. Her serve, or more specifically herball toss remains awry and although her forehand blazes from time to time it lacks consistency: today she might easily have lost the opening set to Italy's Sara Errani before coming through 7–6, 6–3. It was a far from convincing prologue to her defence as the start of the women's tournament. The Philippe Chatrier court was close to perfection on a glorious spring morning, and a reasonable crowd settled down for what they expected to be a gentle beginning. Errani had other ideas, scurrying around with a fervour that soon had Ivanovic, playing in a dress of pool blue (the official colour) dress, looking as if she were flailing. Seeded to meet Safina in the quarter-finals, the Serb will need to seriously raise her game if she is to stand any chance of retaining her title.
