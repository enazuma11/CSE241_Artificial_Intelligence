 The British No1 Anne Keothavong could be facing an extended spell on the sidelines after injuring her left knee playing doubles at the Bank of the West Classic in Stanford last night. The 25-year-old will have a scan later today after running into a fence while attempting to chase down a ball in the first-round match. Keothavong and Japanese partner Ayumi Morita had won the first set 6-4 against Julie Coin and Marie-Eve Pelletier but were trailing 5-3 in the second when the injury occurred. The Londoner was treated on court and had to be carried off on a stretcher. Keothavong wrote on Twitter: "Busted my knee, got a scan in the morning but think I know already." The world No54, who lost in the first round of the singles to Elena Dementieva, would lose a lot of ranking points if she was unable to play in the US Open next month after reaching the third round last year.
