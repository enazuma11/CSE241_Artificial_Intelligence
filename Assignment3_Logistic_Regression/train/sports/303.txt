 Here we go again: "20% of 11-year-olds fail English" (Report, 5 August). How many times do your correspondents have to point out that Sats are not a pass or fail exam? When Sats were introduced, level 4 was the standard which the child of average ability was expected to reach at the age of 11. So already 80% of children are achieving an average or above standard. For what it is worth, this is an incredible achievement. Danny Lewis Fleet, Hampshire • Your report (Mayor of Riga latest to hit out at behaviour of Brits abroad, 5 August) would have been improved by mentioning that Riga's "sacred" Freedom Monument is also the focal point of an annual march in honour of Latvian members of the Nazi SS. John Wilson London • Though I share concerns about behaviour at cricket matches (Headingly ready for booze and boos, 5 August), the reason the snake was so popular was because the cricket was so boring. Even the players kept looking up at the stands when they realised the cheering bore no resemblance to their actions on the pitch. Andy Dixon Bath • Poor old Middlesbrough (G2, 5 August). It's now getting the crap that Hull (my second favourite city in the UK) has been on the receiving end for years. Channel 4 "using scummy footage" to back up claims that Middlesbrough "is a cesspit" is precisely what the media have been doing over the years to blacken the reputation of the fine and friendly city of Kingston-upon-Hull. Pamela Rauchwerger Edinburgh • If our clunkers are so poor in fuel efficiency (US 'cash for clunkers 'scheme lifts industry, 4 August) why don't we just give them to Cuba as a gift? They could replace their old 1957 Chevys. Or maybe we could trade them for good Cuban cigars? Peter Saltarelli Plano, Texas, USA • Surely the National Museum of Funeral History should be located in my hometown and not Houston, Texas. Phil Thorp Bury, Lancashire
