 On the third day of their match at Whitgift School in Croyden, Essex amassed a second-innings total of 244 against Surrey to take them to a slender lead of 176. Surrey began the morning on 391 for six in their Second Division match, and were eventually bowled out for 433, a first-innings lead of 68. Essex's Ryan ten Doeschate cleaned up the Surrey tail, taking five for 143, but Andy Flower was only Essex batsman to offer significant resistance to Surrey's Azhar Mahmood and Nayan Doshi in the afternoon, with an innings of 111 which included 11 fours and two sixes. Cricket Australia has expressed its anger after tickets for this year's Ashes series appeared on auction websites within hours of going on sale. It has specifically asked the auction site eBay for greater assistance in combating ticket touts who are attempting to sell seats at inflated prices. A percentage of priority tickets for the highly anticipated series went on sale to a Cricket Australia members' club called the Australian Cricket Family (ACF) on Friday. Some 270,000 tickets for Tests and one-day internationals have already been sold, and a small percentage have appeared for purchase online. The Cricket Australia public affairs manager Peter Young said it was "absolutely disgusting and appalling" that members of the ACF were looking to make a profit from selling their allocation. A spokesperson for eBay, Daniel Fieler, insisted: "We don't actually sell the tickets. We provide a market place where the buyers and sellers can transact." But Young reaffirmed CA's position and claimed eBay had only provided "limited assistance".
