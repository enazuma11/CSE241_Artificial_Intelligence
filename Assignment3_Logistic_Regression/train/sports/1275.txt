 Roger Federer set up a mouthwatering French Open semi-final with Rafael Nadal as he edged closer to an elusive title at Roland Garros with a straight-sets win over Victor Hanescu today. The world No1 swept into the last four for the first time in Paris, swatting aside Romanian Hanescu 6-2, 7-6, 6-3 with an elegant display. "Being in the semi-finals for the first time here is great," said Federer, who is yet to drop a set. "I'm very satisfied with my game and my form so far. I feel I have plenty of energy left. I'm glad to be able to prove that I can do well in this tournament." He will need to be at his best for the showdown with Nadal, however, after the Spanish teenager powered past David Ferrer 7-5, 6-2, 6-0. Nadal has now won 22 consecutive matches on clay as he bids to become the first player to triumph in the French Open at the first attempt since Mats Wilander in 1982.
