 Uncapped opener Stephen Cook has been added to the South Africa squad for the fourth Test against England. Cook made an unbeaten half-century against the tourists for South Africa A in a warmup match before the series and looks set to replace the out-of-form Stiaan van Zyl. Van Zyl has made just 69 runs in five innings at the top of the order, while Cook has scored two centuries and a 76 in his last three matches for the Highveld Lions. The 33-year-old is the son of Jimmy Cook, who played three Tests for the Proteas. “Stephen has been in excellent form this season and gives us another option at the top of the order,” said chief selector Linda Zondi. Dale Steyn retains his place in a 17-strong squad for Friday’s match in Centurion, but is thought to be struggling with the shoulder injury that has kept him out of the past two Tests. Quinton de Kock is also set to return as wicketkeeper. He was ruled out of the third Test after injuring his knee while walking his dogs, but his replacement Dane Vilas has not been included this time.
