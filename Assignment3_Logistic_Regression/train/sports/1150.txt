 Surprise surprise: after weeks of sunshine in London, it took less than half an hour for rain to stop play at Wimbledon today. Martina Navratilova managed to take a 5-0 lead over Catalina Castano on court two, while British unknown Amanda Jones was leading No11 seed Ai Sugiyama, before the covers were unrolled and the umbrellas went up at 12.30pm. It's a favourite joke that the two most important weeks in British tennis rarely pass without at least a few hours spent watching a bleak sky and replays from years before.  But with play suspended already and the weather forecasts looking fairly grim, we could set fair for a few days of rain-interrupted play.
