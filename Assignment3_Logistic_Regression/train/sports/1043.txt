 Former champion and 18th seed Amelie Mauresmo has made a shock exit in the third round of the Australian Open, beaten by home favourite Casey Dellacqua 3-6, 6-4, 6-4. Earlier world No1 Justine Henin and defending champion Serena Williams moved into the last 16 of the women's draw with straight-sets wins over Italy's Francesca Schiavone and Belarus's Victoria Azarenka respectively. Henin, the 2004 champion at Melbourne Park, didn't have things all her own way against Schiavone, struggling with her serve in a match characterised by exploiting angles and opening up the court rather than power, but was able to break Schiavone when she needed to. After saving two break points when serving for the match she eventually sealed her 7-5, 6-4 win when Schiavone's desperate return from a smash went wide. Williams, on the other hand, was far more comfortable, serving up 14 aces as she cruised past Azarenka 6-3, 6-4 in just 72 minutes at the Rod Laver Arena. She will now face No12 seed Nicole Vaidsova in the next round after the Czech saw of Japan's Ai Sugiyama in straight sets, while Henin will meet the winner of the third-round clash between France's Aravane Rezai and Taiwan's Hsieh Su-wei. Third seed Jelena Jankovic will face the winner of the third-round match between 18th seed Am√©lie Mauresmo and Australia's Casey Dellacqua after securing her own passage to the last 16 with a 6-2, 4-6, 6-1 victory over France's Virginie Razzano. Jankovic, struggling with nagging injuries was spoken to by the umpire during the match, who felt she might have been receiving coaching advice from her mother in the players' box. "I think it was wrong because my mum ... is just supporting over there in my box ... she was not coaching me," said Jankovic. "She was just trying to tell me like 'c'mon, keep going'. She was just trying to lift me up a bit." Maria Sharapova is also through to the fourth round after beating fellow Russian Elena Vesnina 6-3, 6-0. Sharapova will face another compatriot in the next round when she takes on Elena Dementieva, who overcame Israel's Shahar Peer 6-2, 6-0 earlier in the day.
