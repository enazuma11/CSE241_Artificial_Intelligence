 This week host Geoff Lemon is joined by Guardian writer Russell Jackson, Englishman-in-Australia Jonathan Howcroft and the godfather of Sri Lankan cricket broadcasting Roshan Abeysinghe.  Ignoring the temptation to savage woeful England first up, the team instead kick off this week's discussion with the story of Pakistan, who surprised many people with an impressive, magnificent even, performance against heavyweights South Africa. Ireland, one of the best associate nations on show this year, are next on the agenda, with their chances of progression to the knock-out stage assessed by the pod. Ed Joyce will be crucial, but their bowling could well let them down. Attention is eventually turned towards one of the stories and games of the tournament: the upset that was never really an upset, England's miserable defeat to Bangladesh. In brief: an utter farce.  Over to Batticaloa, from where Roshan Abeysinghe dials in to give his thoughts on Sri Lanka's tournament so far – their batting, a possible bowling weakness and the brilliant Kumar Sangakkara. And to wrap things up, a look ahead to what lies on the horizon in the final week of the pool stage, which includes England's final match of the tournament against Afghanistan – and surely the potential for yet more embarrassment.
