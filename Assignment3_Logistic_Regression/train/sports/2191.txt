 Greg Rusedski made a great start to his first-round clash with Korea's Hyung-Taik Lee at the Stella Artois Championship today, but quickly succumbed to the rustiness which has haunted his attempted comeback. Rusedski had taken three sets to beat the same opponent at the Surbiton Trophy last week, but a stuttering performance meant Lee was able to step into round two with a 3-6, 6-3, 6-4 win. The British No2, playing only his eighth match since being cleared of any wrongdoing after a failed drugs test last year, held his opening service game and then broke for a 2-0 lead with a deep forehand which landed inches from the baseline.  The only sign of a lapse in concentration came when he double-faulted to go 15-30 down when serving for the set, but the 30-year-old took the next three points to take the set 6-3 in 28 minutes. Rusedski was not going to have it all his own way, however, and the warning signs were there when he had to save a first break point of the match in the second game of the second set.  He saved two more in his next service game but could not survive forever and a netted forehand gave Lee the crucial break.  The Korean then served out to win the set 6-3 and take the match into a decider. Rusedski looked back on track when he broke in the second game of the decider courtesy of two excellent lobs, racing into a 3-0 lead.  But Lee produced an inspired game to break back with a series of winners on both sides, and then repeated the dose to take a 5-4 lead. The 28-year-old from Seoul then held his nerve to serve out for the match and complete the victory in 97 minutes.
