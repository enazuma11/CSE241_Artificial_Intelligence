 Peter Wilby’s remark about Indians only being allowed to play cricket in India after a “prolonged struggle” (Sticky wickets, Review, 2 August) is an example of the freedom-struggle revisionism that now often passes for history on the Indian subcontinent. For the greater part of the 19th century, Indians took no more interest in cricket than did the British in, say, kabaddi, which like so many local sports had its roots in the martial arts. The first Indian community to take an interest in cricket was the most Anglicised: the Parsees of Bombay, who in 1879 played a cricket match against the British members of the Bombay Gymkhana (founded in 1875 on part of what is now the Azad Maidan). The “prolonged struggle” that Wilby refers to was a brief squabble about parity, which ended in 1884 with the Parsee, Hindu and Muslim communities each being given land for their own gymkhanas. Thereafter the Parsees and British regularly played an annual fixture, although the Parsees refused to play the Hindus for some years, just as the Hindus discriminated against untouchables. The young MK Gandhi enjoyed his cricket and is on record as having watched a game between the town of Rajkot (Indians) and the local military cantonment (British) while a schoolboy in the late 1880s.Charles AllenLondon • England has won 58 gold medals at the Commonwealth Games (England’s record tally shows young the way ahead, Sport, 4 August). And so Jerusalem has been played 58 times as, to quote the stadium announcer, “the national anthem of England”. Furthermore, each home cricket Test match now starts with a rousing rendition of Jerusalem. Isn’t it time for England’s rugby and football teams to follow suit, abandon the illogical singing of the UK’s God Save the Queen, and let Blake and Parry on to the field of play?Michael ElwynLondon
