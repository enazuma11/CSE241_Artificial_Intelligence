 Alex Neil felt last weekend’s defeat at Arsenal was their best away performance against one of the bigger teams this season but the clock is ticking at speed now and three consecutive defeats – with no goals scored – have come at the worst possible time. Another home game in midweek against Watford is an opportunity to pick up points but they cannot afford to have fallen further adrift by then and something is surely required from an upbeat Manchester United.
