 The United Arab Emirates will, according to reports, allow Israel's Andy Ram to play in next week's Dubai Tennis Championships. A UAE foreign ministry official is quoted by the state news agency WAM as saying that Ram would be given "special permission" to take part in the tournament. This follows a report in the New York Times in which it was claimed that the US Congressman, Anthony D.Weiner, had received assurances from the UAE ambassador to the US, Yousef Al Otaiba, that Ram would not be barred from entering Dubai. The decision to grant Ram a visa to enter Dubai, one of the Emirates, comes after the government's denial of a visa to another Israeli, Shahar Peer, the 48th-ranked women's player in the world. She was to play in this week's WTA tournament in Dubai. Tournament officials cited local public opinion about Israel's incursion into the Gaza Strip, the possibility of a spectator boycott and the security of Peer as reasons to deny her a visa. "It was my sense from the ambassador that he was looking to do the right thing, but that's small consolation to Miss Peer," added Weiner. "He understood that they had made a mistake and they had a public relations problem."
