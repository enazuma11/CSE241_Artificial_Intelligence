 Lindsay Davenport believes Kim Clijsters could be on the verge of a return to professional tennis. Clijsters, 25, retired in May 2007 and gave birth to her first child in February last year, but Davenport revealed that the former US Open champion has been seeking her advice on travelling the circuit with children. "Kim Clijsters sent me an email with questions about how to travel and live with a child on the WTA circuit," said Davenport, who did so herself in 2007 after the birth of her son Jagger Jonathan. "So I think she will play WTA tournaments beside exhibition games in Wimbledon and the United States." Clijsters will play alongside Tim Henman, Steffi Graf and Andre Agassi in a series of exhibition matches to test Wimbledon's new Centre Court roof on 17 May. And earlier this week her former coach Carl Maes admitted he would not be surprised if the former world No1 did make a comeback. "When she stopped I never said it would be the last time we would see her on the tour," he said. "I think it's too early to tell but, somewhere in the back of her mind, it must be something that she's considering. If she's fit and wants to play then I think it's a possibility. I wouldn't be completely surprised."
