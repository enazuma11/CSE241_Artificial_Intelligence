France rally against Ireland to advance to the quarter-finals, where they’ll be joined by Germany and Belgium, who saw off Slovakia and Hungary respectively. Plus, Spain and Italy prepare to face off once more, while Iceland await England Presented by 
 On tonight’s Eurotastic Football Daily, AC Jimbo is joined in the pod by James Horncastle and Alan Smith to look back on a far better day at the Euros than yesterday’s sorry fare.  We begin by analysing Belgium’s brutal dismantling of Hungary. Beware, Wales, beware. Next, Iain Macintosh relives his experience in Lyon as France came from behind to hand Ireland their bottoms, while Rafa Honigstein waxes lyrical about Germany who – to no great surprise – proved they were much too much for Slovakia. What’s in store for tomorrow, then? Well, Spain do battle with Italy (again), and England take on Iceland. Should be tasty, if not a little emotional.
