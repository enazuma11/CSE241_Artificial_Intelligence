 The Celtic striker Leigh Griffiths has been crowned PFA Scotland player of the year for the first time. He collected the prize at a glittering dinner ceremony at Glasgow’s Hilton Hotel. His triumph came a day after he scored his 39th goal of an impressive campaign as the Parkhead side in effect wrapped up their fifth straight title with a 3-1 win at Hearts. Rangers’ Mark Warburton was named manager of the year after leading the club back into the top flight in his maiden campaign, while the Celtic defender Kieran Tierney took the young players’ prize. Griffiths’ success is the second time in four seasons he has been recognised for his individual efforts after he collected the Scottish Football Writers’ Association’s top prize and the union’s young player award following a 28-goal campaign with his former club Hibernian in 2013. He was up against the Dundee duo Kane Hemmings and Greg Stewart as well as Aberdeen’s Jonny Hayes but becomes the third Celtic player in as many years to lift the award following Kris Commons and Stefan Johansen. Griffiths’ Celtic colleague Tierney was also celebrating as the unflappable 18-year-old capped a fine debut season by lifting the young player of the year trophy. Tierney was the only top-flight candidate and was up against Rangers’ Barrie McKay and the Hibs pair Jason Cummings and John McGinn, but he was the stand-out performer. The Isle of Man-born teenager has been a virtual ever-present in Ronny Deila’s line-up since ousting the Honduras international Emilio Izaguirre from the left-back slot last December, with his contribution earning him a first Scotland cap in March’s 1-0 friendly victory over Denmark. Meanwhile the Championship player of the year award went to the Rangers captain Lee Wallace, who has led by example with a series of outstanding displays for the league champions.
