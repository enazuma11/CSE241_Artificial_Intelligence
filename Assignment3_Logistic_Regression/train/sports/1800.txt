 Serie B is introducing a green card in an attempt to promote fair play in the Italian second division. The initiative will make its debut on Friday night in the Spezia v Bari game at the Stadio Alberto Picco. The cards will be “virtual” as they will not be handed out during matches but every player can earn one by putting the ball out of play, assisting the referee or even admitting to diving in the penalty area, according to Gazzetta dello Sport. The Serie B president, Andrea Abodi, said: “It’s a symbolic award. It can be something very simple. The important thing is to recognise acts of fair play. This is just one part of a series of initiatives on and off the pitch. Respect has to come first and that’s where this green card comes into play.” The initiative is being introduced in collaboration with the Italian Refereeing Organisation with the aim of changing the image of Italian football and motivating players to promote good behaviour on the pitch. At the end of every month the league will announce a list of all the names of the players who have been given a green card. Click here to read more from Gazzetta dello Sport’s coverage in English.
