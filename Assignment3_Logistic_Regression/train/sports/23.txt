 Australian cricketers are to present a list of security demands to the Indian Premier League after terrorist threats against the competition, the players' union said today. Most Australian players involved in the IPL met with Australian Cricketers Association chief Paul Marsh in Sydney today to be briefed on the latest security developments in India. Marsh said players were concerned by existing security plans for the Twenty20 league and would demand arrangements be upgraded. A Pakistan-based guerrilla group linked to al-Qaida warned last week it might carry out attacks on sports events in India, principally the IPL, the men's field hockey World Cup and the Commonwealth Games in New Delhi in October.
