 Tim Henman appeared remarkably cool and level-headed during his 6-3, 6-3 win over James Blake in baking heat at the Canadian Masters here yesterday.  Toronto has been burning in a heatwave for the past few weeks and the benefit for the British No1 has been a marked quickening of the hard courts. He may need this bonus when he takes on Argentina's David Nalbandian, the Wimbledon finalist, today in the third round.  Against Blake, Henman saw his serves and volleys come off the slick surface often so low and fast that even the fleetfooted American could not get to them. The forehand appeared in good shape too and Larry Stefanki, sitting courtside with Henman's heavily pregnant wife, Lucy, looked most impressed with his charge.  Henman's win took just 1hr 20min, and he faced only one break point and that not until deep in the second set.  Perhaps Henman might have expected more of Blake, a 22-year-old with a modelling contract who is the latest to be dubbed the future of American tennis. But his game has yet to complete the perfect package.  Henman's relentless aggression exposed the American's weaknesses time and again and he was made to pay for his tendency to hit flashy shots which, like him, are easy on the eye but do not quite get the job done.
