 There could be worse places for Sam Allardyce to take charge of his first game as Crystal Palace manager – his new club have a remarkable record at Vicarage Road having won six times and lost only once in their past 10 league visits. Walter Mazzarri’s Christmas wish must surely be for Troy Deeney and Odion Ighalo to find form – the pair have four league goals between them so far compared to 16 at this point last season.
