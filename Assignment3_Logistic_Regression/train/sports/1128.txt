 Venus Williams overcame a sluggish start against Italy's Francesca Schiavone to reach the quarter-finals of the Australian Open. The sixth seed had to recover from losing her first set at the tournament before winning 3-6, 6-2, 6-1 in just under two hours at the Rod Laver Arena. The American is chasing her first ever title at the Australian Open – the only major she has yet to win – and will now play the winner of the match between fourth-seed Caroline Wozniacki and Li Na in the last eight. Williams came into the match having never lost in five previous meetings with the 17th-seeded Italian, but struggled to find her rhythm on serve early and was immediately broken to love in a game that included two double faults. Schiavone broke again to go 3-1 ahead with a clever lob that caught Williams out of position, but the American fought back to level at 4-4 before another double fault gave Schiavone the break again. The Italian then served out the set with an ace. Williams's service problems continued at the start of the second set as she was broken for the fourth time in five games. The seven-times grand slam winner's recovery started when she immediately broke back as she won six of the next seven games to level the set. Williams was broken again at the start of the deciding set, but she found another level that Schiavone could not live up to and peeled off the next six games to go through to the last eight.
