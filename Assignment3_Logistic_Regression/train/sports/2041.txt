 TIMOFEE'S BIG DAY Timofee didn't sleep too well last night. Not because he was two sets to one down against American Todd Martin with the hopes of an entire nation resting on his aristocratic shoulders because Greg had crashed out. No, no. Timofee had read himself a horror story before bed, and it had given him the willies. "It wasn't my best night's sleep ever," he admitted. "I scared myself a bit. But it was a different story today." Enid Blyton, or some such. Always a favourite.  Whatever it was, it did the trick. Our Timmy came bounding out like his namesake, the Famous Five dog, and promptly broke Martin's serve and his resolve. The bionic man, who seems to have a different joint strapped up in tubi-grip each day, had no answer to Tiger Tim's tenacity. Probably because he's really old. "When you're two sets to one down you have to try and get things going quickly and I did that and I'm pleased to get through," said Tim who has now reached the quarters for the fifth time. * * * * * * * * * * * * * ONE IN, ONE OUT Sport loves nothing better than a bit of sibling rivalry to spice things up. Jack and Bobby Charlton? They were like pieces of chalk and cheese that never saw eye-to-eye. When Ralf Schumacher soaked his big brother in Bollinger on Sunday after Michael beat him in the Grand Prix, he was really hoping it would trickle down into Michael's y-fronts to make them really sticky. And tennis has the Williams sisters. Or at least it did. Until today. "I'm not alive right now," said the spectral Serena in the post-mortem following her 6-7 7-5 6-3 loss to Jennifer Capriati. Of course she's not dead. That was just a joke from Serena, the little minx. It's just that she hasn't eaten in four days, and she had to have a technicolour yawn half-way through today's match, bless her. So that's why she lost and ran away crying at the end. Not because Capriati was better and she is a poor loser. For Capriati, winner at the French and the Australian Opens, the Grand Slam is still on. The all-new Clean-Cut Cap no longer steals from the corner shop or smokes things she shouldn't. And as if to reinforce her comeback queen status she won after being two points away from defeat at 30-0 and 5-3 down in the second set. But she decided to go to the loo too. And after curling a fat one, she squeezed out Serena to book her place alongside Serena's sister in the semis. That's better. * * * * * * * * * * * * * WHAT HAPPENED ON COURT?

Fastest serve: Men  Timofee 132mph Women  Venus 121mph  * * * * * * * * * * * * * QUOTE OF THE DAY "If Tim goes all the way it will be the worst ever tennis result for bookmakers and we'll be at least a quarter of a million pounds worse off." William Hill spokesman Graham Sharpe is swept along by the nation's tennis fever. Timmmy is 6-1 on to win first place by the way.  * * * * * * * * * * * * * PUNDIT'S CORNER - "Golly, I don't think she was ready for that service." - "Hell, come on. You're supposed to play at the server's pace. Those are the rules Virginia." John Mac the Knife wades in to Virginia live on air. * * * * * * * * * * * * *  FABULOUS FACTS There is £8,497,360 total prize money for this year's Championships. In 1968 when prize money was first awarded at Wimbledon, the total was £26,150. The cost of a ticket for the first Wimbledon Gentlemen's Singles final in 1877 was one shilling, the equivalent of 5p in today's money. The first radio broadcast of The Championships was in 1927.  * * * * * * * * * * * * * END OF ASTROLOGY WITH LLEYTON HEWITT Lleyton has taken his final bow at this years Championships. And, belatedly, we also realised that he hadnt written any of that numerology nonsense. So when we discovered Astrology meets Pat Rafter (http://www.geocities.com/mina_19087/) we were excited, but only for a minute as it turned out to be the same Antipodean pap. So instead, heres a picture of Greg Modesto going a bit crazy with a tennis racket http://www.personal.psu.edu/users/j/a/jaz130/gguitarbig.htm
