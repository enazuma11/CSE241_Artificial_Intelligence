 Greg Rusedski joined Tim Henman in the second round of the Pacific Life Open here, notching one of his biggest wins of the year with a 6-4, 6-3 victory over the third seed Juan-Carlos Ferrero.  Rusedski's policy of relentless attack proved too much for the Spaniard, and though the British No2 was in efficient form, his task was made easier by Ferrero's lacklustre display. Given that Ferrero only recently recovered from a thigh injury, Rusedski's win had a air of predictability about it.  Predictability, however, is not a vice Andre Agassi could ever be accused of. The Las Vegan's flair for the unexpected has not diminished with age, neither has his propensity for entering tournaments looking like the best player in the world and leaving them in the first round looking as though he isn't sure which end of the racket is which.  Having turned up for the Masters Series event here with only one loss in his past 10 matches, he lost 7-6, 7-6 to the unfancied Swiss Michel Kratochvil in the first round.  Agassi had been on a tear in the last fortnight since recovering from the wrist injury that kept him out of the Australian Open. In his first week back he lost to Lleyton Hewitt in the final at San Jose, then followed that up by winning his first tournament of the year last week in Scottsdale.  But Agassi looked all a dither yesterday, fussing and fretting over a thigh injury and allowing it to throw him off his stride. As defending champion he had plenty of motivation and he fought hard throughout the match, coming from a break down in both sets to force two tiebreakers, but he simply could not string enough good shots together to make the hard work pay off.  Agassi now falls out of the top 10 in the ATP rankings and heads to next week's Masters Series event in Miami needing to defend the stack of points he earned by winning there last year. Another loss like this and he may struggle to maintain a place in the top 20.
