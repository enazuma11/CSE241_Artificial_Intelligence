 Great Britain have been pitted against Austria in the Davis Cup World Group play-offs in September. John Lloyd's team, who were unseeded, will enjoy home advantage against Austria, ranked 15th, as they bid to avoid relegation from the competition's top tier following February's 4-1 loss to Argentina. Gilbert Schaller's Austria side, who lost their first-round match against the US 4-1, will be pinning their hopes on Stefan Koubek, the world No61, and Jurgen Melzer, ranked 74th. Britain will be placing their faith in Andy Murray, who missed the trip to Buenos Aires with a knee injury. Lloyd has confirmed that he will remain as David Cup captain for a further three years. "I'm delighted to be continuing my role as captain until 2011 and am looking forward to building on the progress we have made over the last four ties," he said. "The hard work for both Paul [Annacone, Davis Cup coach] and myself starts here as we start to prepare for September's tie against Austria." Lloyd's renewed commitment to the British cause was warmly received by Roger Draper, the Lawn Tennis Association chief executive. "John has been a tremendous captain over the last two years and has transformed the team, so it is great news that he will continue for another three years," said Draper. "While we have had some success recently it is vital that we start to identify younger players who are capable of thriving in a Davis Cup environment, and I am confident that John and Paul can make some real progress in this area." Draper will be hoping that progress encompasses a better result than when Great Britain and Austria last met, in 2004, when the British team suffered a 3-2 defeat.
