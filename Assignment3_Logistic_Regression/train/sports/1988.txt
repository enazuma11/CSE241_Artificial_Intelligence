 Tennis has moved a significant step closer to having its entire drug testing programme under one umbrella with the International Tennis Federation (ITF), the governing body, set to take over the Association of Tennis Professionals' anti-doping regime at the start of next year. The ATP, the professional men's authority, which is half owned by the players, was severely criticised last year by Dick Pound, the head of the World Anti-Doping Agency (Wada), after seven players, including Greg Rusedski, were cleared of doping offences involving nandrolone. Pound said there was an obvious conflict of interest, and stressed the need for drug-testing and result management to be independent. This has now been achieved in an agreement running until the end of 2010. The ATP will pay the ITF a six-figure annual sum to help run the programme. This agreement includes at least 600 tests at ATP events annually, in addition to the 500 tests on male players at events under ITF jurisdiction. The cases will be managed by the ITF from the collection of samples through to any appeal at the Court of Arbitration for Sport. Before yesterday's announcement, the ATP had failed to sign up to Wada's anti-doping code of conduct, claiming it was concerned about the anonymity of any player failing a test. Such concerns are no longer relevant. The final step for the ITF is to persuade the WTA, the women's governing body, to hand over their anti-doping programme also. The ITF is keen to increase the number of tests on women players, which currently falls well short of the men's level.
