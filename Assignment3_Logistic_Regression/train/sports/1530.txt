Former Australia fast bowler issues an apology for safari trip in 2008 after pictures circulated on social media of him posing with dead animals  
 Australian cricket legend Glenn McGrath has drawn a barrage of hostile reaction after pictures of him posing with big game killed on a safari holiday began circulating on social media. McGrath, a keen hunter, is seen posing with a dead water buffalo, elephant and hyenas in Zimbabwe in 2008. The pictures were posted on the website of Zimbabwe-based tour company Chipitani Safaris but have been taken down. They were captioned “Glenn McGrath 2008”. But the reaction of people on social media was angry with many calling for a boycott of McGrath’s cancer charity works.  “Shooting wild animals and posing in front of them isn’t cool @glennmcgrath11,” one Twitter user posted. McGrath, who describes himself on Twitter as a “philanthropist and outdoorsman”, later released an apology saying that he had taken part in the licensed hunt but now regretted it. “In 2008 I participated in a hunting safari in Zimbabwe that was licensed and legal but in hindsight highly inappropriate. It was an extremely difficult time in my life and looking back I deeply regret being involved,” a statement on Twitter said.
