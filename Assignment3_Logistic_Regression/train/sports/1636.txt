 Anthony McGrath has not been a recent feature of England's one-day squads, but with no sign of a settled side for the World Cup next year, Yorkshire's maturing batsman is not about to give up hope of adding to his 14 ODI caps. A serene 80 against Sussex at Headingley yesterday continued his confident start to the season. McGrath's century stand with Darren Lehmann was the only bright spot for Yorkshire. It ended when he pushed Mushtaq Ahmed to silly mid-off. Lehmann, after a brisk 64, fell to a smart return catch by Luke Wright. Sussex dismissed Yorkshire for 272, but their captain, Chris Adams, erred when he was penalised five runs for fielding with the glove of the wicketkeeper Matt Prior. At Trent Bridge the Warwickshire batsman Moeen Ali, 18, scored 68 not out on his championship debut to help lift the leaders, who had been put in, to 248 for nine after they had been 83 for five against Nottinghamshire. Moeen, an England Under-19 player, is the cousin of England fast bowler Kabir Ali and the brother of Kadir Ali. Ian Bell's poor form is a worry before next week's first Test against Sri Lanka. After top scoring in the series against Pakistan in the winter Bell's form and confidence fell away against India. In his first game for Warwickshire this season, he scored eight before he was out pushing half-forward. Few opening days are as one-sided as the one at the Oval, but without the stoicism of Gloucestershire's Phil Weston, Surrey might already be revelling in a first-innings lead. In more than four hours of sensible accumulation Weston compiled 102, which was his first championship century for nearly two years. It was also 79 more than his nearest colleague and on a pitch where first-innings par was roughly twice Gloucestershire's 207. Surrey were 132 for one at the close. Doug Insole, the former Essex and England cricketer and selector, has been named as the MCC's new president.
