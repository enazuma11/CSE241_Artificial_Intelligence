 Three top 10 seeds crashed out of the Australian Open today as the tournament began to heat up on the eve of the second week. Jo-Wilfried Tsonga's astonishing campaign continued as the unseeded Frenchman dumped out his compatriot Richard Gasquet in the fourth round. Tsonga, who disposed of the ninth seed Andy Murray in the opening round on Monday, moved into the quarter-finals with a 6-2, 6-7 (5-7), 7-6 (8-6), 6-3 victory over his close friend in three hours and 19 minutes. Nikolay Davydenko had no answers to fellow Russian Mikhail Youzhny as the 13th-ranked man eliminated the world No3 7-6 (7-2), 6-3, 6-1. And David Nalbandian was the third big name to fall at Melbourne Park, the 10th seed handed a straight-sets thumping by the former world No1 Juan Carlos Ferrero. There was no great escape for the Argentinian in this match as Ferrero found his best form to win 6-1, 6-2, 6-3. It is the first time Ferrero has made the fourth round of the Australian Open since he reached the semi-finals in 2004, while it is Nalbandian's worst showing in the event since 2002. But it was the crowd-pleasing Tsonga that captured the imagination of the fans on day seven. The world No38 looked at home in his second match at a near-capacity Rod Laver Arena, using a blend of fierce baseline power and finesse at the net to record the win over his country's top-ranked player. Gasquet, ranked eighth in the world, took the second set but watched the athletic Tsonga storm back. Tsonga regained the ascendancy in the third set tie-breaker with a superb backhand up the line and whipped through the fourth to set up a battle with Youzhny. When asked what the difference was between himself and his countryman, Tsonga replied: "I don't know. At the end, I won and he lost," he said. "I played well. I felt very good in my body. Everything felt good." Tsonga is quickly becoming the rising star of the tournament, much like the recent finalists Marcos Baghdatis and Fernando Gonzalez before him. "I'm very comfortable in this arena," he continued. "Every time I played it has been full, so there is a very good atmosphere, and I feel very good on this court." Meanwhile, Philipp Kohlschreiber's impressive run is over after Jarkko Nieminen won an entertaining four-set clash between the pair at Margaret Court Arena. Nieminen, the 24th seed from Finland, dropped the first set 6-3 in 37 minutes as Kohlschreiber carried on the form that took him past the American Andy Roddick in the previous round. In back-to-back tie-breakers - which ended 9-7 and 11-9 in favour of Nieminen - the Finn set up a two sets to one lead and comfortably held sway to seal a place in the final eight with a 6-3 scoreline in the fourth set. Nieminen had not been beyond the third round before this tournament. His title push will continue against No2 Rafael Nadal who was handed an easy passage to the quarter-finals when his opponent Paul-Henri Mathieu retired hurt. Nadal was leading 6-4, 3-0 when the Frenchman's troublesome lower leg led to his retirement.
