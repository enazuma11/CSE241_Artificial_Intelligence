 Andy Murray put last weekend's Davis Cup demons well and truly behind him to claim a place in the world's top 100 at the Thailand Open. The Scot won two tight sets in Bangkok to overcome fifth seed Robin Soderling 7-6, 7-6 in the second round and will now face third seed Robby Ginepri for a place in the semi-finals. After beating George Bastl in straight sets in the opening round, Murray faced a sterner test in Swede Soderling, a two-time ATP winner in Lyon and Milan, and ranked 50 places above him. But the 18-year-old rose to the challenge, although it was a far from easy contest. Both sets ended in tie-breaks, with Murray winning the first 7-3, and the second 7-5 to book his place in the last eight. "It's a pretty big deal for me, getting to the top 100 when I'm 18," said Murray. "I said at the start of the year that's my goal. After the first couple of months a lot of people told me I should have kept quiet. But I'm pretty happy with myself now. "I wasn't feeling that great towards the end of the first set. But I took a time-out and got some medication from the doctor. I had a really sore head - I don't know why. "But I thought I played a pretty clever match. I used my slice pretty well and I didn't give him so much pace which I think he likes. I returned well in the first set and when I had to in the second. I thought I could have served better and maybe attacked a little bit more, but it was a pretty big match for me and I'm just happy to come through."
