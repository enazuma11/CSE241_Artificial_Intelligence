 Ireland have won the Dubai Tri-Series after their final match against Scotland was rained off on Monday. There were hopes for a reduced 20-over contest after heavy rain and thunderstorms around the ground, but further rain just before the rescheduled start brought the tournament to a disappointing end. “Rained off … did not see that coming. Next cricket – World Cup” tweeted the Ireland batsman Ed Joyce. Ireland secured the title with five points from their four matches, one point better off than Afghanistan and two more than Scotland.
