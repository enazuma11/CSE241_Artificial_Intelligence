 Medium-pacer Daniel Worrall will make his international one-day debut for Australia on Tuesday in the one-off clash with Ireland in South Africa. The swing bowler with a distinctive angled run-up stood out for South Australia during last season’s Sheffield Shield when he was the competition’s second leading wicket-taker with with 44 at 26.18. Australia’s captain Steve Smith confirmed on Monday that 25-year-old Worrall will take his place in the XI for the match at Benoni, which precedes a five-match ODI series against South Africa starting on Friday. Worrall will share the pace-bowling duties with Scott Boland and John Hastings, who were impressive in Australia’s recent 4-1 ODI series victory in Sri Lanka. Worrall’s Redbacks teammate Joe Mennie and Victoria’s Chris Tremain are also likely to get a shot against the Proteas with Mitchell Starc and Josh Hazlewood remaining in Australia. Smith returns having flown home early from Sri Lanka midway through the limited-overs series while Mitch Marsh is also back having been rested after the crushing 3-0 Test series defeat. Australia XI: David Warner, Usman Khawaja, Steve Smith (capt), George Bailey, Mitch Marsh, Travis Head, Matthew Wade, John Hastings, Adam Zampa, Daniel Worrall, Scott Boland.
