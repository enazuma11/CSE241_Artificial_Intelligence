 Martina Hingis secured her first win in more than five years over her long-time rival Lindsay Davenport in the fourth round of the Pacific Life Open yesterday, beating the American 6-3, 1-6, 6-2 in their 25th career meeting. Davenport, who is ranked No4 in the world, is the second top-five scalp Hingis has collected since returning to the tour in January, following her victory over Maria Sharapova in Toyko in February. Yet as much as confirming her ability to compete with the very best players in the world, Hingis's victory over Davenport, who appeared hampered by a sore back during yesterday's encounter, was also about renewing a long and fascinating personal rivalry between the two women. Their first competitive meeting came in Sydney 11 years ago and they had played 24 times before Hingis announced her retirement from the game in October 2002, a decision she reversed by coming back to the tour at the beginning of this season. Despite the doubts that swirled around the Swiss former world No1 when she returned to competition at the Gold Coast tournament in Australia in the first week of this year, there now seems no question that she is capable of reclaiming a place in the top five, if not the No1 ranking she once held for 209 weeks in a row.
