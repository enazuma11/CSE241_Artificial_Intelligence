 Macclesfield Town are on the hunt for a marquee signing to bring to the Moss Rose Stadium, after placing an advert for an “enthusiastic lion tamer”. The club, who are mid-table in the National League, are offering a voluntary position for someone to “feed and exercise” the club mascot Roary on match days, as well as helping with training, rehearsals, and medical care. “As the official Lion Tamer of Macclesfield Town FC, you will provide a key role in making sure Roary fulfils his roles on a matchday including entertaining the crowd at the Moss Rose and posing for photographs with supporters,” says the club’s website. “No prior experience of dealing with lions is required as full training will be provided. But the successful applicant must be confident and energetic.” The website lists a full description of the successful applicant’s required tasks: It is not the first unusual advert Macclesfield have placed. In 2013 the club hoped to raise £20,000 by offering one person the chance to play for the team, but later scrapped the plan.
