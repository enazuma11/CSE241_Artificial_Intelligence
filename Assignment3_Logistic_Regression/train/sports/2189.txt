 It is hard to know where to turn for the next sporting thrill of the summer. The possibilities for drama seem so boundless that Andy Murray might even win Wimbledon and lay the 72-year-old ghost of Fred Perry. Or maybe Roger Federer will rise from his alleged nadir. We have just witnessed an extraordinary week in sport, a tapestry of excellence across the world. Top of the list was Tiger Woods winning a major on one leg. Shane Williams dazzled yet again, in a losing cause for Wales against South Africa. Then there was Kevin Pietersen, single-handedly (or switch-handedly) giving batsmen everywhere an incentive to reinvent themselves as magicians. At the European Championship we witnessed some wonderful deeds, most notably by Turkey and Germany. In the US, the rehabilitated Boston Celtics finished off the Los Angeles Lakers to win their first NBA title since 1986. Aidan O'Brien dominated at Royal Ascot, with an unprecedented four group One wins in three days.  Only a fool doubts the magic in the hands and feet of Federer. But plenty of smart tennis people think it is fading, a view strengthened when he lost a one-sided French Open final to the wizardry of Rafael Nadal. Victory at Wimbledon would park Federer back alongside Woods, Williams, Pietersen, the Euro heroes, the Celtics and O'Brien. It could be a fortnight to savour.
