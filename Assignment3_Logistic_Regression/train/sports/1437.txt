 West Indies' captain Chris Gayle has warned his side that they must improve on their "terrible display" in the first one-day international or risk a whitewash by Zimbabwe. The Zimbabweans, who also won the Twenty20 International on Sunday, snatched a two-run victory defending a total of 254 for five in Guyana, despite West Indies reaching 99 without loss and 126 for one. It was their first win against a top-level side since 2007. "Well done to Zimbabwe, they did well," Gayle said. "They wanted it more than us, you could see from the way they went about their batting. "We got off to a good start, but it was a terrible display of batting at the end. If we don't learn, we're going to get beaten. If we carry on like this Zimbabwe will beat us 5-0. It was a terrible display. We need to dig ourselves quickly out of this hole. There's a lot of things to put on the table and discuss." Zimbabwe captain Prosper Utseya insisted he was always confident his batsman had done enough. "I said after we won the toss it was the average score, so we just believed we could get 250 and with the way we're bowling at the moment it would be enough," he said. "I'm very proud of the guys. It was a good team effort. They're still a good side. For us to beat them we need to remain focused and retain discipline." The next match of the five-game series is on Saturday, also in Guyana.
