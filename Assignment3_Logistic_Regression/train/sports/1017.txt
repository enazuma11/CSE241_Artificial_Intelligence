 Andy Murray set up a 'Battle of Britain' clash with Tim Henman at the Rogers Cup in Toronto tonight by claiming a straight-sets win over 12th seed David Ferrer. Henman overcame fellow veteran Jonas Bjorkman to reach the second round and Murray has now joined him following a 6-2 7-6 (8-6) victory.  The match went with serve to 2-1 in Murray's favour when the 19-year-old raced into a 0-40 lead on the Ferrer serve in game four, but failed to capitalise on any of the three break chances. The Scot held and then again took command on the Ferrer serve, but after seeing two further break opportunities go begging he finally seized the initiative at the sixth attempt to go 4-2 up. Once more the British number one was safe enough on serve and remarkably had three more break points in the eighth game.  Murray's confidence was high as his 24-year-old opponent struggled to settle in the second set and two breaks of serve helped him into a 5-0 lead. Ferrer won the sixth game and at the time it appeared he had merely avoided total embarrassment. However, after saving one match point he broke Murray to cut the gap to 5-2.  The Spaniard dug in well and staved off another match point chance before he held for 5-3, and incredibly broke again to close within one game. He held for 5-5 and then missed a break point chance to go ahead, Murray eventually edging back in front.  The tie-break was inevitable and it was predictably tight, with Murray edging it 8-6. The win for Murray tied the head-to-head record between the pair at 1-1, Ferrer having won their only previous meeting in Barcelona earlier this year.
