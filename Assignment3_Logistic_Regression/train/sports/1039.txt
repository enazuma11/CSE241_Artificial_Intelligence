 If Andy Murray felt furious on waking up yesterday to find himself out of the world's top 20 for the first time since August 2006, dropping nine places to 22nd, he did a fine job of hiding it. He was the picture of cheerfulness as he chatted and posed with children at a leisure centre in south-west London. Murray happily - not a word often associated with him - admitted that he was prone to losing his temper during matches but worried that the public mistakenly thought he was permanently scowling off court as well. "The way I am on the court doesn't necessarily make me that way off it," he said. "Once you get on the court it's not about being polite to people, it's about winning, and that's the most important thing at that time and you go out and do your job the best you can. If that means getting a little bit pissed off then I think that's OK because you want to win. The reason a lot of guys are great at the sport they do is because they are competitive and they'll do anything to win. The best players expect high standards, and if they are not achieving those high standards then it's normal to get annoyed."
