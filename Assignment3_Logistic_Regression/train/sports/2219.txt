 Nadia Petrova announced herself as one of the front-runners for the French Open title for the first time when she scored a surprise win over Belgium's Justine Henin-Hardenne, the reigning champion, in Berlin yesterday.  Petrova showed great concentration and stamina in winning 4-6, 6-4, 7-5, relieving Henin of her German Open title only two weeks before her attempt to do the same to her Roland Garros crown.  Petrova came to the net much more than Henin in achieving her fourth title of the year and her 15th successive win on clay. "Of course there will be expectations [for the French Open] but I will just try to have fun," said Petrova.
