 The England and Wales Cricket Board looks certain to commit English domestic cricket to three competitions next season – a 16-match championship, the 50-over Friends Provident Trophy and an extended Twenty20 tournament – after a final consultation with county chairmen and chief executives at Lord's today. The decision by the ECB board next Wednesday will formally confirm the abandonment of plans to stage two separate Twenty20 competitions and will represent a desire to protect championship cricket after a brief flirtation with an illusory world of endless Twenty20 bestowing huge riches. T20 will grow all the same, with counties playing 16 matches in two divisions of nine, but the competition will continue to alleviate rather than transform county finances. David Collier, the ECB's chief executive, said: "The consensus of opinion was clearly for three competitions with a desire to preserve the primacy of Test cricket and the LV County Championship.'' Twenty20 is likely to take place in the first half of the summer, with 50-over cricket then taking over until a Lord's final at the end of August. Some county chief executives were concerned by England's participation in future Champions Leagues – the world club tournament in Twenty20 – which has provisionally been scheduled for September 2010 and could potentially clash with the end of the domestic season. The ECB's view will be that the Champions League has yet to achieve a settled position in the cricket calendar and that it has little choice but to draw up a domestic programme with a traditional mid-September finish for the championship. If the Champions League dates clash and exclude the champions of English T20 then England might reluctantly have to withdraw and the Champions League would lose legitimacy as a world competition as a result.
