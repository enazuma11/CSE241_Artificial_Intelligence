On court In a nutshell Announced herself at Wimbledon in 1999 when, as a qualifier, she beat Martina Hingis in the first round. Her father Damir had announced himself a couple of weeks earlier by getting thrown out of the Edgbaston event and arrested. Grass or pass Previous quarter-final and semi-final finishes prove she's consistent on grass. The biggest variable is which country she's turning out for each year. Distinguishing feature Superstition. Watch as she blows into her right palm before receiving. Count as she bounces the ball five times before a first serve (twice before a second). Go wide-eyed as she avoids stepping on the court's lines without losing the point or falling over. Yes, it sounds tricky to us too. Hot shot  Ground strokes on both sides.

British claim Once rumoured to be applying for a British passport for the collection, although she denies this vehemently. But then, you would. Luvvy rating With Damir for a dad, she gets a healthy sympathy vote. 6/10 The winning formula Serbian wallop - dad x Aussie attitude = Yugo-Australo-American party
