 Jamie Murray endured a first-round defeat almost as disappointing as his brother Andy yesterday when he and his new partner, Max Mirnyi, were beaten 7-6, 1-6, 6-3 in the doubles by the French pair Edouard Roger-Vasselin and Gilles Simon. The Murray brothers arrived in Melbourne bouncing with ambition about what they were going to achieve at the Australian Open yet both will require patience as well as optimism as they develop their games. Andy, who was courtside to watch his sibling yesterday, is trying to bed in a new coaching team while Jamie is attempting to develop an understanding with Mirnyi. Yesterday's match was only their fourth together and, while both are accomplished doubles players, that does not guarantee them the sort of telepathy all great teams have - at least not immediately. "I'm pretty gutted to be honest because I think we played a pretty decent match. They played well, probably better than we expected them to," said Murray. "We were a little bit unlucky in some regards but that's the way it is. I'm sure we'll get better the more we play with each other. "The more you play, the more you get to understand your partner - where they like to stand on the court, the shots they like to play and all that. I think the harder we work as a team, the quicker we will gel. I'm sure we'll do that." Murray and Mirnyi need time to develop but they will now spend almost a month apart, chiefly because the Murray brothers have a gruelling Davis Cup tie in Argentina in February. "I'm really looking forward to [the tie]," Jamie Murray said. "That's why you play tennis: to play for your country, to play in these places. The crowd might get on your back a bit but it's fun."
