 Andy Murray confirmed his Wimbledon promise by winning the Comerica Challenger in California with a 6-4, 6-3 win over fellow wild card Rajeev Ram on Sunday night. The 18-year-old Scot used his full repertoire of shots to become the youngest winner in the tournament's 19-year history, a victory which puts him in 164th position in the ATP rankings.   "I had to work hard to make the right shot," said Murray. "Rajeev was getting to passing shots that nobody else has been getting to. It seemed like he would just stick out his racket and the ball would come back."  Ram served at 4-5 in the first set and had two chances to pull level at 5-5. But Murray kept coming up with big service returns and eventually won the set with an uncontested back-hand winner down the line.  "I want to congratulate him. He is tough to beat when he is returning and making passing shots so well," said Ram.  Murray now heads to the RCA Championships in Indianapolis where he has again been awarded a wild card.
