 The British No1 Anne Keothavong was swept aside in straight sets by her top-seeded opponent Caroline Wozniacki in the semi-finals of the Cellular South Cup in Memphis. The 25-year-old Londoner, ranked 52nd in the world, had no answer as the teenage Wozniacki won their first ever meeting 6-1, 6-0 in less than an hour. Keothavong was taking part in the third WTA Tour semi-final of her career, and second this year, but is still to reach a final. Denmark's world No12 Wozniacki will meet the second seed Victoria Azarenka, from Belarus, in the final, after the latter's 6-4, 3-6, 7-6 (7-1) victory over Germany's Sabine Lisicki.
