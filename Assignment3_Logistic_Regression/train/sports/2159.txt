 Tim Henman swept away nine months of Grand Slam graft to make a perfect start to his French Open challenge. The British number one was in aggressive form as he bludgeoned his way to a 6-2, 6-3, 6-1 victory against Vladimir Voltchkov in the first round at Roland Garros. Henman's serve, under pressure in recent weeks, was working well and his ground shots were impressive as he showed no sign of the shoulder injury which required surgery late last year and kept him sidelined for four months. However, his fans should not get carried away because Voltchkov, whose claim to fame is having reached the semi-finals of Wimbledon in 2000, has not won a match on clay since 1998. His discomfort on the surface was apparent throughout as he struggled to move with any fluidity and sprayed unforced errors, especially on his wild forehand, all around court three. Henman's sole concern was a nervous start, in which he lost his first service of the match, but once the Oxfordshire player had found his rhythm the man from Belarus was no match for his superior all-court game. Henman breezed through the first two sets and then stepped up the pace even more in the third to break Voltchkov's service three times to race to an impressive triumph in one hour and 40 minutes. He now plays the winner of the match between America's Todd Martin and Argentinian Jose Acasuso in the second round.  Greg Rusedski, however, found an injury-enforced nine-month lay-off too much to overcome as he was knocked out of the French Open in the first round by 21-year-old Russian Nikolai Davydenko. Having not played since he was defeated by Pete Sampras in the US Open last September, the British number two was comprehensively beaten in straight sets 6-3, 7-5, 6-2.
