 England's players completed the first stage of their preparations for this winter's Ashes series after returning home from their "development camp" in southern Germany today. Andrew Strauss, the team's captain, said the trip had been a worthwhile venture: "Following our trip to Flanders last year, this was an opportunity for the players to spend time away from the cricketing environment, learn more about the wider world and develop ourselves both individually and collectively." The five-day camp saw the 16-member squad undertake a series of team-building exercises before visiting the memorial site at Dachau, the first of Nazi Germany's concentration camps where more than 40,000 people died. "It was a tough but rewarding five days and I know every player has gained greater insight into themselves, their own team environment and environments outside cricket," said Strauss. England will fly out to Australia next month before beginning their Ashes defence in the first Test at the Gabba on 25 November.
