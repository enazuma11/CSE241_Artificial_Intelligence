 Andy Murray will take on Dominik Hrbaty in the third round of the Paris Masters this afternoon after fighting off sickness, fatigue and a determined challenge from Juan Ignacio Chela last night. The Scot beat the Argentinian 7-5, 6-0 to earn what at times had seemed an unlikely victory. Murray is recovering from a throat infection and needed medical advice at the end of the first set.  He dropped his serve early in the match but came back to level at 4-4. Chela faded fast from there.  "I was really struggling in the first six or seven games of the match with my breathing. I wasn't able to practise that much because of the illness," said Murray.  "But it was a great second set. He started well and maybe I could have started better but he's not in the top 40 for nothing."
