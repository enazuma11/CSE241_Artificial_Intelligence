 Christian Eriksen has signed a contract extension with Tottenham Hotspur and the 24-year-old Denmark midfielder has committed himself to the Premier League club until 2020. Eriksen, who signed from the Dutch club Ajax in August 2013, said in an interview with Spurs TV posted on the club’s official Twitter feed: “There is a great future at this place and I wouldn’t have signed if I didn’t see that.” Eriksen has made more than 130 appearances for Tottenham and is confident Mauricio Pochettino’s group of players have what it takes to build another sustained title challenge – in a season in which they are also back in the Champions League. “Since I came in the last two years we have been going forwards, are taking steps upwards and I want to be a part of it,” said Eriksen, whose new deal is reported to be worth around £70,000 per week. “I see a great future. It is going only one way at the moment. I think it is a very good group of people and players who can connect with each other and a group of staff who connect with the players. We have an idea of where we want to end and hopefully we will achieve that.” Pochettino has been busy in the summer transfer market to bolster the squad, with the signings of Victor Wanyama from Southampton, the Dutch forward Vincent Janssen from AZ Alkmaar and the 21-year-old winger Georges-Kevin Nkoudou from Marseille, while the France international Moussa Sissoko arrived from Newcastle United on deadline day in a £30m deal.
