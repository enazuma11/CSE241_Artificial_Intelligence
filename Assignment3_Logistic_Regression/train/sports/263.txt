 Haroon Lorgat has been appointed as the International Cricket Council's new chief executive. The 47-year-old former convenor of selectors in South Africa will be inaugurated as Malcolm Speed's successor following this summer's ICC Annual Conference, which is scheduled to take place between June 29 and July 4. Lorgat's appointment was confirmed by the ICC Board following a meeting between the South African and David Morgan, the ICC president-elect, in Pretoria. Lorgat said: "I am grateful to the ICC for appointing me as its new CEO and look forward to an exciting and rewarding journey in a game I have truly loved from a very young age. I am delighted to be appointed to the role and am really excited by the opportunity to contribute my energy, skills and passion at the highest level. I am under no illusion about the challenges that await me but those challenges are also opportunities and I cannot wait to start work at the highest level in such a great game." Lorgat had been on the shortlist when the ICC named fellow South African Imtiaz Patel as its preferred candidate for the post, before Patel subsequently declared he was not interested in the position.
