 You wait decades for a batting record to fall, and then two go in a single week. Just as Ben Stokes strode out to the crease in Cape Town to pick up his innings from the previous evening and ended the day setting a fistful of new English records for the speed and size of an innings, across the Indian Ocean a 15-year-old schoolboy walked out on to a smaller, dustier pitch and proceeded to smash a batting record that had stood for more than a hundred years. Over two scorching Mumbai days Pranav Dhanawade accumulated an almost unbelievable 1,009 not out. The previous record for the most runs had been set in 1899 by James Collins, himself born in India and who died at Ypres in 1914, but who, aged just 13, scored 628 not out in a junior house match at Clifton College. For 116 years, Collins’ record has remained an annual feature of Wisden, until the son of an auto-rickshaw driver led out KC Gandhi High’s team to meet Arya Gurukul school in an under-16 league. It should be said that they were playing a younger side because the older Arya Gurukul boys had exams. And Pranav Dhanawade is already something of a titan in schoolboy cricket, having twice been out recently not far short of 100. But all previous records now lie in tatters. At stumps on day one, he had hit 652 from only 199 balls. By lunch on day two, he had broken the thousand mark. At 3pm, his team declared on 1,465 for 3. On his way to his 1,009, he hit 59 sixes and 129 fours off 327 balls. In the style of his hero, Sachin Tendulkar, he merely observed: “The runs kept on coming.”
