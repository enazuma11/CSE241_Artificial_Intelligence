 Andrew Flintoff is unlikely to play for Lancashire this season, according to the county’s head coach, Ashley Giles. Flintoff made a surprise return for Lancashire last season, almost helping the Red Rose county to victory in the Natwest T20 Blast final, having spent the previous four years in retirement, and subsequently signed to play for Brisbane Heat in Australia’s Big Bash League. At last week’s launch of this year’s T20 blast, the 37-year-old Flintoff hinted he would sit down with Giles to discuss the possibility of featuring this season but his former England team-mate has revealed no such talks have been forthcoming. “He is a hard person to track down. I have sent him a text but I have not heard anything at the moment,” Giles told Manchester Evening News. “Therefore, if I was hedging my bets, I would say no, he won’t play a role this summer.”
