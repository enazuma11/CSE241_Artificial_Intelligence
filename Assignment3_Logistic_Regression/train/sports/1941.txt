• Midfielder dismissed in 2-1 defeat at West Bromwich Albion on Saturday• Cameron in contention for Capital One Cup semi-final, first leg on Tuesday Press Association 
 Geoff Cameron is free to face Liverpool in Stoke’s Capital One Cup semi-final, first leg against Liverpool on Tuesday after the club were successful in their appeal against the red card the midfielder received in the defeat by West Bromwich Albion on Saturday. Cameron was facing a three-match suspension having been sent off for violent conduct by Lee Mason after pushing Claudio Yacob in the back of the neck during Stoke’s 2-1 defeat at The Hawthorns. Stoke said on Monday they were appealing and a subsequent statement from the Football Association said: “Geoff Cameron has had his three-match suspension withdrawn with immediate effect after his wrongful dismissal claim was successful. “An Independent Regulatory Commission found that the match referee had made an obvious error in dismissing the Stoke City player for violent conduct during the game against West Bromwich Albion on Saturday.”
