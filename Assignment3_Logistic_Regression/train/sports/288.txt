 Surrey kept alive a slim chance of making their fourth finals day with a last-over victory here last night thanks to 65 off 32 balls from their all-rounder Azhar Mahmood. The visitors seemed in trouble from the off - James Benning directing the second ball to backward point and Mark Ramprakash tickling the eighth for a leg-side catch at the wicket. When Rikki Clarke holed out at midwicket, Billy Taylor was on his way to a spell of two for 16 while Dimitri Mascarenhas weighed in with four overs for 11, leaving Surrey at 55 for five in the 12th over after Ali Brown (28 off 21 balls) was caught on the boundary. That was when Mahmood began the rescue operation. It started slowly but by the end of his 86-run stand with Scott Newman, the ball was vanishing to all parts. Mahmood went to his fifty with a six over long-on - his third - and then immediately scattered the crowd around the ice cream vans at square leg with his fourth. In all 61 came off their final four overs but it appeared in vain when Chris Benham manoeuvred Hampshire into a winning position with a patient 38 before he swept Nayan Doshi to backward square with 49 needed off the last eight overs. Cue panic to set in. Mascarenhas went without scoring, Shaun Udal slipped and was run out, Nic Pothas became Doshi's third victim and Chris Tremlett his fourth. Hampshire needed 11 off the last over. Ramprakash's direct hit from cover, running out Taylor, settled it.
