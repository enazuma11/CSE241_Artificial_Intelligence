 The good vibes surrounding English cricket didn't last long: Michael Vaughan will miss the CB Series finals against Australia with a recurrence of his hamstring injury. Vaughan, 32, aggravated his torn left hamstring in the 14-run victory over New Zealand on Tuesday which sent England into the best-of-three contest against Australia that starts at the MCG tomorrow. He will fly home on Saturday, although his participation in next month's World Cup is not in doubt. Yet. It is a huge blow for England. Even though Vaughan was out first ball against New Zealand, he was arguably the Man of the Match after giving an imperious display of imaginative, flinty captaincy under pressure. His presence seemed to simultaneously soothe England's brow and harden their nose - as well as liberating Andrew Flintoff to bowl with fire and brimstone. Now, however, Flintoff will be captain for the matches against Australia, 48 hours after the England coach Duncan Fletcher publicly confirmed what has been obvious for most of the winter: that Flintoff is inhibited by the captaincy. Vaughan, by contrast, is empowered by it, and his injury is a bitter personal blow. "It has been very disappointing on this tour to have no problems with my right knee and then a hamstring comes about," said Vaughan. "I am desperate to play but we have to look at the future and certainly the next few weeks with the World Cup in mind. "The medical staff have told me there is absolutely no doubt I will be on the plane for the World Cup."
