 Andy Murray plans to improve on his two previous encounters with his fellow 19-year-old Novak Djokovic when he tries to reach his first Masters Series final today. Murray was at the end of an exhausting season when he let slip a lead of a set and a break to lose to Djokovic in Madrid in October, and was too injured to have much hope when he lost to the Serb in the Indian Wells semi-final a fortnight ago.  "I shall try to throw him off his rhythm a bit," said a fitter Murray, whose quarter-final success against Andy Roddick gave the world No12 from Scotland more wins on the 2007 tour than any other player, 23, with only four defeats. Djokovic, however, who broke into the top 10 for the first time this month, enjoyed a career-best win in his semi-final, 6-3, 6-4 against Rafael Nadal, the world No2 to whom he lost in the Indian Wells final.
