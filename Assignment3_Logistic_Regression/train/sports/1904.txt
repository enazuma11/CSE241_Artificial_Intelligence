 Gianni Infantino is set to be interviewed by a member of Fifa’s ethics committee amid allegations that the president breached world football’s governing body’s code of ethics. Infantino, who strongly denies the allegations, will be spoken to as part of a preliminary investigation. If it is decided that a formal inquiry should be opened, Infantino could be suspended for 90 days. Fifa’s president, who took the role in February, is alleged to have acted to destroy recordings of a Fifa council meeting in Mexico. There are also claims that he discussed how to dismiss Domenico Scala, the head of the audit and compliance committee. Scala is responsible for setting Infantino’s wage and Infantino is alleged to have described the £1.3m salary offer as an “insult”. Infantino also faces allegations of expenses irregularities. A Fifa spokesperson told BBC Sport: “The Fifa president has stated publicly he fully respects the independence and work of the ethics committee and that he would provide, if required, whatever information necessary to facilitate any potential review by the committee. “The president has made clear that he has acted appropriately and in accordance with Fifa’s code of ethics.” The BBC added that Infantino was said to be very confident no action will be taken.
