 Click to enlarge and debate the strip below the line. 1) He’s not going to be popular. You can’t award the goal – he has knocked it in from an offside position, so his side have failed to take the advantage you correctly played. Instead, take the game back to the goalkeeper’s offence, and caution him for his act of unsporting behaviour. Restart with a direct free-kick to the attacking team. (More on this in the comments). Bruce Nelson wins the shirt. 2) So let’s get this straight – he wants to skip his kick and have his team’s penalty specialist take it for him? That’s just not going to happen. Speak to his captain and explain clearly that if the player refuses to participate, you will abandon the game. And let him know that, if the game is called off in those circumstances, the authorities will kick them out of the tie. The taker needs to get on with it. Thanks to Andy Murty. 3) Tell this attacker he’ll be booked if he walks off the field of play without permission. You should also explain to him that there is nothing in the laws of the game that means a tackle is only rash and dangerous if physical contact is made. “Tripping or attempting to trip an opponent” is an offence – so if this defender has launched himself into a dangerous challenge then he is guilty of a red-card offence – even if there was no contact.
