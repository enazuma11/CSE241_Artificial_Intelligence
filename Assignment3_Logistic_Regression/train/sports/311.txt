 Anya Shrubsole took three late wickets as England women held their nerve to pull off a dramatic 15-run win in the first Twenty20 International against South Africa in Paarl on Thursday. England appeared under pressure at Boland Park as their hosts reached 96 without loss by the 15th over, in pursuit of 147 for seven. Shrubsole returned to take three for nine in her second spell as South Africa faltered to 129 for six and Sarah Taylor’s earlier unbeaten 74 proved a telling factor for the tourists. Taylor hit 11 fours from 51 balls as England eked out a defendable total, having found themselves 41 for three and then 81 for five after being put in by the South Africa captain, Mignon du Preez. The England captain, Charlotte Edwards, back at the top of the order after moving to No3 in the one-day internationals, Tammy Beaumont and Amy Jones all fell cheaply. Taylor and the tailender Shrubsole engineered a big finish to England’s innings, scoring 18 from Shabnim Ismail’s final over. Dane van Niekerk and Trisha Chetty got the chase off to a sound start with scores of 52 and 46 respectively, operating at just over a run a ball. However, after Shrubsole came back to have Van Niekerk caught in the deep, and then Chetty fell lbw in the next over to Jenny Gunn, no other South Africa batter could muster double figures. England have the chance to wrap up the series if they can win at Newlands on Friday to open up an unassailable 2-0 lead.
