• Both players were out of contract this summer at St James’ Park• Pair were ‘not going to feature in remaining games’ for Tyneside club Press Association 
 Gabriel Obertan and Sylvain Marveaux have been released by Newcastle United after frustrating spells on Tyneside. Both players were out of contract this summer but with little prospect of being involved in the club’s final two games, against Aston Villa and Tottenham Hotspur, settlements have been reached to allow them to pursue their respective careers elsewhere. A club statement said: “Newcastle United can confirm that Gabriel Obertan and Sylvain Marveaux have left St James’ Park by mutual consent. “The contracts of the French pair were due to expire this summer, but with them almost certainly not going to feature in the Magpies’ remaining games of the 2015-16 season, a settlement was agreed earlier this week allowing them to find new clubs. “Everyone at Newcastle United wishes Gabriel and Sylvain the very best for the future.” Obertan, 27, made 77 appearances for the club he joined from Manchester United in August 2011, but none of them have come since September last year. Marveaux, who spent last season on loan at Guingamp, has not played for Newcastle – for whom the 30-year-old former Rennes midfielder made 57 appearances over five years – since March 2014.
