 Celtic will introduce safe-standing areas from the start of next season. The club confirmed in their season-ticket renewal information that rail seats would be installed at Parkhead over the summer. The modified area will be in the corner of the Lisbon Lions stand, where the Green Brigade fans’ group are located. Celtic were granted permission from authorities in June last year to introduce the safe-standing area – based on versatile seating common at German grounds. The initial plan was to accommodate up to 2,600 supporters.
