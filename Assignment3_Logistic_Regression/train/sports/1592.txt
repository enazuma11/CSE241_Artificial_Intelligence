 England's leading players could come out in support of a worldwide strike to force a reduction in the amount of international cricket. Tim May, head of the international players' union, has refused to rule out the possibility in his attack on the non-stop diet of Tests and ODIs. May, chief executive of the Federation of International Cricketers' Associations, claims the best players in the world are being "flogged" and that international cricket overkill is the one issue on which strike action cannot be ruled out.  The International Cricket Council has hailed its new Future Tests Programme as a triumph but, with India already packing the schedule with additional tournaments, May has labelled it "a disgrace". Cricket's rulers could soon be shaken from their complacency. Seven of the 10 Test-playing nations now have player associations affiliated to Fica and May predicts Pakistan, Sri Lanka and, crucially, India will sign up by the end of the year. May says in July's Wisden Cricketer: "The FTP is a disaster as it puts no upper limit on the amount of cricket that can be scheduled. There are five or six guys in the five leading sides in the world who play Tests and ODIs and they are being flogged. They are the ones who make the difference between a 10,000 crowd and a sell-out. They are the ones who the broadcasters and commercial partners pay for. They are exhausted and they are not going to take much more. It is a mess."  Jacques Kallis, the South African allrounder, yesterday endorsed May's comments. "For all-rounders it's definitely too hard a schedule," he said. "It's killing them." England's coach Duncan Fletcher has also expressed his concerns.
