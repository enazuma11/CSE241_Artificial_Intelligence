 Andre Agassi has admitted he would have been wiser to play Wimbledon rather than the earlier French Open to prevent strain on the unstable sciatic nerve in his back. The 35-year-old advanced on Tuesday night in his first match since the embarrassing defeat by Finland's Jarkko Nieminen at Roland Garros two months ago, crushing France's Jean-René Lisnard 6-1, 6-0 in the Mercedes-Benz Cup.  After winning in only 47 minutes the American reflected on the agonies of his nerve problem, which now requires pain-killing injections to keep him on court. "It was not the right call to be in Paris with all that stretching and moving on the clay - I should have been in London" he said.  "I was out on the court in Paris and I literally couldn't move. Everything was hurting me . . . to sit down, to stand, to walk. The nerve can go from not so good to incapacitating."  He last appeared at Wimbledon in a 2003 fourth-round defeat by Mark Philippoussis, and at Roland Garros he has not won a match since the quarter-finals that year. "I feel like I missed Wimbledon two years in a row and I feel I've missed the French two years in a row," he said.  But with his condition now under control Agassi is making no decisions on retirement. "I won't assess anything until the end of the year."  ·Andrew Murray reached the second round of the Granby Challenger in Canada with a 6-2, 7-6 victory over his fellow Briton Richard Bloomfield.
