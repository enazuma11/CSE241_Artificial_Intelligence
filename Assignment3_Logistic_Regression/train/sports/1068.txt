 Daniela Hantuchova's coach said yesterday he was worried that the Slovakian player was underweight but dismissed talk of anorexia as she won her opening match here at the German Open.  Nigel Sears, who until two years ago worked for the Lawn Tennis Association, said: "I am concerned that she is underweight. But she is not anorexic. "She is fit and strong, but she is burning off more calories than she is taking in. This is a sensitive issue for young girls. They see fashion items which to wear they must not be a couple of pounds overweight.  "But we have to confront it. I am hoping she will get back to the right weight, and I would like to feel that by Eastbourne and Wimbledon there will be a difference."  Hantuchova, the No7 seed, hit the ball solidly enough but still had to battle hard to beat Barbara Schett, a former top-10 player, 6-3, 4-6, 6-3.  There was one worrying moment when Hantuchova jarred her right knee with the handle of her racket as she tried a backhand slice to a ball that bounced badly. She needed several minutes' treatment and more than an hour after the match she was complaining that the pain was increasing.  The titleholder Justine Henin-Hardenne produced a 6-4, 6-1 win over Daja Bedanova and some fighting talk. "I beat Serena Williams for the first time this year and I think you are going to see some changes," she said.  The British No1 Elena Baltacha, who reached the third round last year, has been given the all-clear to compete at Wimbledon after consulting a specialist about the liver complaint which has left her susceptible to fatigue.
