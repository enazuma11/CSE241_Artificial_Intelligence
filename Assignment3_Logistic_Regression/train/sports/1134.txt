 Greg Rusedski defeated Xavier Malisse 7-5, 4-6, 6-1 to reach the second round of the Millennium International Tennis Championships at Florida's Delray Beach. The British No2 proved too powerful for the Belgian despite the fact that the match did not finish until after midnight because two hours of play was lost to the weather.  He will now meet either Robert Kendrick or Matias Boeker of the United States in the next round.  The defending champion Jan-Michael Gambill was knocked out by Mario Ancic, the man who defeated Tim Henman in this year's Wimbledon quarter-finals. The third seed fired down nine aces and won 74% of the points on his first serve en route to a 6-3, 6-4 victory over his unseeded opponent.  Gambill said: "I was very excited to come back here but I just missed a lot of balls and he served well. It comes down to me making too many errors on the court."  Ancic's fellow Croatian Ivo Karlovic, the No5 seed, was defeated in a dramatic three-set encounter with Paul Goldstein. Karlovic went down 4-6, 6-3, 7-6 despite serving 19 aces.  Arvind Parmar's hopes of notching up his second victory of the year on the ATP tour were dashed yesterday when the British No3 lost 6-3, 6-2 in the first round of the China Open to Israel's Noam Okun.  Parmar had to go through qualifying, in which he won three matches, to reach the main draw, but his appearance was anticlimactic.  The 26-year-old from Hitchin, who is a month older than Okun, has now won only one of seven matches on the circuit this year, although he has been more successful on the Challenger Tour.  His ranking in the ATP's entry system was 185th coming to China, with his most notable success this year being the Challenger event he won in Vietnam in late February.
