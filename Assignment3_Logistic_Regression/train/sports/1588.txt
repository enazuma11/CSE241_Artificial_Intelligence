 Big year for Simon Jones, hero of the 2005 Ashes, who joins from Glamorgan after a couple of seasons ruined by injury. Captain Vikram Solanki Coach Steve Rhodes 2007 Championship 9th (D1) Pro40 Winners Friends Provident 4th in North group Twenty20 quarter-finals In Simon Jones (Glam), Chris Whelan (Middx), Mehraj Ahmed (2nd XI), Gareth Andrew (Som) Out Doug Bollinger (Aus), Phil Jaques (Aus), Nadeem Malik (Leics), Ray Price, Shaftab Khalid, Roger Sillence (all released) Overseas Steve Magoffin (Aus) until Fidel Edwards (WI) arrives Indian effect  Vikram Solanki played in the ICL during the winter and believes sanctions are a restraint of trade: "Sport is a short career and you must take opportunities to maximise your earning potential." Pinning their hopes on The new seamers Chris Whelan and Gareth Andrew, peripheral at Middlesex and Somerset but much needed here because of understandable doubts about some of the bigger bowling names. Foreign flavour Steve Magoffin should better the achievements of his fellow Australian predecessor Doug Bollinger, then much will be expected of Fidel Edwards. Well I never New Road flooded again in January - but there was no damage to either outfield or square. Bob Willis's verdict The flooding last year damaged their season and as a result I think they can improve this time. If they can keep Simon Jones and Fidel Edwards fit they will be great additions for their squad.
