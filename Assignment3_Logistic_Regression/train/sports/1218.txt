 Tim Henman battled past the Czech Bohdan Ulihrach 7-5, 6-3 in Rotterdam yesterday to reach the world indoor tournament semi-finals for the third time in four years.  Britain's No1, seeded sixth, had to work hard to achieve the victory after abandoning his trademark serve-and-volley game to mount his challenge from the baseline. Following an exchange of breaks midway through the first set, Henman wasted three set points at 6-5 on the Czech's serve before finally clinching it following a double fault by Ulihrach.  Henman started the second set sluggishly and was broken in the second game following three forehand errors. But he immediately piled on the pressure to break Ulihrach's next two service games before serving out for the match. Henman will now meet the big-serving Croatian Ivan Ljubicic for a place in the final.  Venus Williams, who will take over as world No1 next week, struggled with a knee injury as she suffered her first defeat in six meetings with Sandrine Testud. The No4 seed won 1-6, 7-6, 6-4 in the semi-finals of the Dubai championships. Testud will contest an all-French final with Amelie Mauresmo, who scored a surprise victory over the second seed Monica Seles, 6-4, 6-3.  Gustavo Kuerten is another top player with injury concerns. He is to have surgery on a hip problem and looks likely to miss the French Open, which starts on May 27.  Â· You've read the piece, now have your say.
