 Grand Slam Tennis 2 is the latest sim to incorporate EA's now familiar analogue-stick controls (also recreated on PlayStation Move), as used in Fight Night and MMA. "Total racket control", as it's called in GST2, aims to offer precise command over shot power and accuracy. And indeed, once mastered, the benefits are clear: it enables deliberate placement of shots around the court, creating competitive and exciting rallies and winners that rival the slick control seen in last year's acclaimed Top Spin 4. As you'd expect, there's a full roster of players, including legends of yesteryear such as Becker, Sampras and Edberg, enabling classic past/present match-ups. But what really sets GST2 apart from the original release on the Nintendo Wii is its responsive control system, which combines with comprehensive online gameplay to make it, for now, the tennis title to beat.
