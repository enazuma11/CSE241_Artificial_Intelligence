 A new hawk is making his debut at Wimbledon this year as organisers try to tackle problem pigeons the natural way. Specially trained birds of prey have been used to scare off pigeons since 1999 but this year is a first appearance for 26-week-old Rufus, a Harris hawk. Rufus flies up into the girders and rafters of the show courts to discourage the birds from roosting. The All England Club is keen to be rid of pigeons because they can distract players by settling on the baseline between games and because of the health risk posed by their droppings. Rufus's owner and trainer, Wayne Davis, said it was no surprise the courts attracted the birds. "This is a brilliant place for pigeons," he said. "You could not design a better pigeon loft, with all the girders and all the high-quality grass seed they put out." Davis also flies a peregrine falcon high above the SW19 courts every morning to scare off pigeons. "It [a bird of prey] is a predator at the top of the food chain, like a lion or tiger of the bird world," he said. "The problem is that there are very few natural predators for feral pigeons in London."  Rufus's debut was marred by first-day nerves - on his first flight he settled on the roof of Centre Court, and Davis had to climb up to retrieve him.
