 The only way Ana Ivanovic could have looked less convincing as top seed here was if she had actually lost to Vera Dushevina in the first round yesterday and so become the first world No1 in US Open history to be upset in her opening match. The Serbian managed to avoid that ignominy but her delight after eventually beating the unheralded Russian 6-1, 4-6, 6-4 was not the reaction of a player with realistic hopes of winning the title. Since capturing her first grand slam title at the French Open in June this year, the 20-year-old Ivanovic has struggled with the sort of mental and physical hangover which has afflicted many a first- time major winner down the years. Her third-round defeat at Wimbledon was characteristic of a post-Roland Garros comedown and she has come to this US Open having barely played since then. She made little impact in the only tour event she entered, in Montreal, and was then forced to pull out of the Olympics with a thumb injury.  Her lack of such serious action very nearly cost her yesterday's match, in which she led by a set and 4-2 only to lose her way. When she served for the match at 5-4 in the third set she missed a string of makeable shots and double-faulted on her first match-point before Dushevina eventually put her out of her misery.  The Serbian has yet to acquire the haughty, self-confident swagger of a champion. Dinara Safina, who was runner-up to Ivanovic in Paris, does not have it yet either but she looked a good deal more assured as she despatched the American Kristie Haerim Ahn 6-3, 6-4 to earn her second-round berth.
