Today we had Will Macpherson at the Ageas Bowl for action between Hampshire and Surrey, plus all the rest from around the grounds, including Nottinghamshire v Somerset  
 Will Macpherson So that’s your lot. Good day’s cricket here, and perhaps even better elsewhere (I’m looking at you, Colwyn Bay). Batsmen seemed to enjoy themselves more than bowlers. Night all! Updated
 Will Macpherson Thanks for your company today folks, it’s been a hoot. Surrey have closed 332 for four, and look totally in control. Just going to pop round to talk to Rory Burns and then I’ll close shop back here. Man - well, boy - of the day, without doubt, is Aneurin Donald. What a knock! 
 Will Macpherson THIS IS THE CRICKET THAT MATTERS RIGHT NOW 100 stand between Northeast 73* & Stevens 44*. Kent move to 301-3 & collect a 3rd bonus point. #ProperCricket pic.twitter.com/3gOOZo7P6c 
 Will Macpherson But, that’s not so good for Notts. Brendan Taylor is fuming with himself. He's charged Leach and hit if straight to Overton at long on. Taylor made 21. 295/3 
 Will Macpherson A fine, fine day Steven Mullaney. 150 for Steven Mullaney of 252 balls. His previous Notts best was 139. 295/2 
 Will Macpherson Finch has been fun here. He’s whacked Berg over extra cover for six a couple of times, and is just generally feeling rather belligerent. Smith has put lots of men back for him but he’s taken Surrey past their third batting point, and has 44. It’s 311 for four and he has Davies for company. 
 Will Macpherson And, next over, Berg got Roy for a second consecutive duck ... @Bergy646 WATCH: @Bergy646 takes the important wicket of Roy, trapping him lbw. pic.twitter.com/Mqj2jiYZ9C 
 Will Macpherson Here’s Berg getting Sibley for 99. @Bergy646 WATCH: @Bergy646 bowls Sibley for his first wicket of the match pic.twitter.com/aeUnzVmOTF 
 Will Macpherson Wickets at Colwyn Bay, too. WICKETS | Lloyd finds the fielder off Palladino to fall for 30, before Wagg is bowled by Davis for 0. 307/6. #GLAvDER 
 Will Macpherson Trent Bridge news ... no good for Somerset. Oh dear Somerset. Mullaney is dropped by Trescothick at slip, a sitter when he's on 140. 259/2 
 Will Macpherson Oh, dear. Dom Sibley has gone for 99. It’s the new ball what done ‘im. Gareth Berg, having been pumped uppishly down the ground earlier in the over by Aaron Finch, just got Sibley to prod half-forward and he’s bowled him. Looks a decent bit of bowling, and it’s earned Hampshire a bowling point! Not been a bad fightback here, all things considered. 
 Will Macpherson Durham are on top at Southport. Tom Smith falls to Onions caught behind for 1. Bad game for the opener who scored 0 in the first innings. @LancsCCC 3-1. 
 Will Macpherson Somerset have a second wicket too! Lumb goes caught behind to Jack Leach. It’s 235 for two there, and you can watch it here.  
 Will Macpherson Durham all out for 291, a lead of 87, at Southport. What an intriguing game that is shaping up to be. 
 Will Macpherson Another wicket for Hampshire, and another for Crane, who has plugged away fairly gallantly. Ansari the man to go, stumped by McManus after skipping down and, well, missing it. He looked a bit surprised to be given but it looked pretty out from where I’m sat. 231 for two. 
 Will Macpherson Wouldn’t have bet on Sussex getting a bowling point before Kent got a batting point, but what do I know, eh? Denly c Taylor b Whittingham 78. Kent 199-3. Darren Stevens joins Sam Northeast 15*. 
 Will Macpherson Here’s how Rory Burns got to Surrey’s 2,000th ever first-class century. Watch @roryburns17 move to his century today, the 2000th First Class hundred for Surrey pic.twitter.com/7EEX4Rrlqi 
 Will Macpherson Mullaney doing work. You can watch it all here. Emphatically done, and a reception to match from Trent Bridge. @Mull05 reaches 100 with a six #NottsvSom pic.twitter.com/Hq40zizIkh 
 Will Macpherson Tea. At 3.40. What is this? We’ve got our overs in on time. My word. Surrey are 209 for one, and beautifully placed. 
 Will Macpherson A wicket! A blooming wicket! Well that’s a surprise. It’s Burns who has gone for a brilliant 122, and the score is 208 for one. Crane got him, just feathering an edge to Slugger Ervine, the lone slip, when trying to cut.  There’s been a wicket at Trent Bridge too, Jake Libby gone for 90. 
 Will Macpherson Surrey have a batting point! You fancy they’ll want four more on this track. Four overs til tea and they are going very nicely indeed. Burns, who has 120, looking very good indeed. A wicket up at Southport! WICKET! Breakthrough as Jarvis bowls Coughlin for 26. Durham are 240-7 with a lead of 36. 
 Will Macpherson Will Bragg is on fire. FIFTY | Another @CountyChamp half-century for Braggy. Watchful, but solid stuff from the Gwent man. 183/3 #GLAvDER pic.twitter.com/C05mXFLeAZ 
 Will Macpherson Tough day in the dirt for Sussex improves rather... WICKET.. Dickson departs for 81, Whittingham gets the breakthrough and Beer takes the catch at backward point. Kent 164 for 2 #GOSBTS 
 Will Macpherson Eat that Big six from Collingwood against Anderson, pulled into railway line. New ball needed as the other is on the 14.57pm to Lime Street. 232-6 
 Will Macpherson Mmm delicious It might not be a batting day @HomeOfCricket but it is @edgbaston where a certain @Ian_Bell has 45 off 29 #Blast16 pic.twitter.com/CaA6AvBA39 
 Will Macpherson Jeez, Young Nye not mucking about FIFTY | It's a very brisk half-century for 19-year-old Aneurin Donald. Coming off just 38 balls. 164/3 #GLAvDER pic.twitter.com/2mHBMa1Rrf 
 Will Macpherson A century for Rory Burns! His first of the season! And Surrey’s 2000th ever in the Championship. He flicked his 144th ball, from McLaren, through square leg for four. His 145th went for four too, a beautiful cut bisecting the two men in the deep. He made it to 100 in the same number of balls it took Sibley to reach 50. Superb knock, this. 
 Will Macpherson This, also, is Surrey’s best opening stand of the season, followers of the Rey will not be surprised to hear. It’s 164 for none. 150 up for Notts, 152/0, both Mullaney and Libby have 71. This is the best opening stand of the season. Previous best was 86. #nottsvsom 
 Will Macpherson Useless, that Anderson. Useless. Great battle between Anderson and Collingwood ends as Jimmy's second bowling spell of the day goes wicketless. Durham lead now: 207-6. 
 Will Macpherson A half-century for Sibley! All very easy for Surrey here. Burns has 92, and is looking really good. It’s 158 for none. Batted @DomSibley who moves to 50 from 140 balls with 8x4 pic.twitter.com/pxyrczFc82 
 Will Macpherson Sounds flat at Tunbridge Wells ... Sean Dickson reaches 50 off 113 balls with a slog sweep for six (5x4). Stand of 107* with Joe Denly 43*. Kent 109-1.
