 Neil Warnock is in pole position to become Rotherham’s new manager until the end of the season. The former Sheffield United, Queens Park Rangers, Crystal Palace and Leeds manager is set to replace Neil Redfearn at the New York Stadium, with the task of keeping the Millers in the Championship. Warnock, who played for the Millers between 1969 and 1971, has been working as an adviser at QPR, but Press Association Sport understands an appointment in South Yorkshire is on course. The short-term nature of the job is understood to appeal to the 67-year-old, who lives in Cornwall. He will be charged with ensuring Rotherham survive in the second tier, a tough task with 16 games of the season remaining. The Millers are in the relegation zone, three points from safety after back-to-back defeats to fellow strugglers Charlton and Bolton. Those losses cost Redfearn his job just four months and 21 games into a two-and-a-half year deal, with the Millers board acting decisively in a bid to stave off relegation. Nicky Eaden is currently in caretaker charge of the Millers, less than a week after joining the club as Redfearn’s assistant manager. An appointment could happen before Saturday’s visit of Birmingham, which opens a gruelling run of fixtures, where they must play sides currently in the top eight in six of their next eight matches.
