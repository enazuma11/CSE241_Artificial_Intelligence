 Burnley will finally discover how much compensation they are to receive from Liverpool for Danny Ings on Tuesday when a tribunal convenes to decide the striker’s fee. Ings left Turf Moor for Anfield last summer after his contract expired but as he is under 24, Burnley are entitled to compensation for his development. The two clubs were unable to agree a deal last summer – Liverpool valued Ings at around £6m and Burnley at £10m – and will make representations to a tribunal in Manchester. Ings will attend the hearing along with the Liverpool chief executive, Ian Ayre. The Liverpool striker made his England debut in October but subsequently suffered a cruciate ligament injury that has prevented him from appearing for Jürgen Klopp. The injury is not expected to have a bearing on the fee. Explaining why it has taken 10 months to reach the tribunal stage, Burnley’s chief executive Dave Baldwin said recently: “The reason it is different to the ordinary is this tribunal claim will be the biggest in history. The key to this was that we bring the claim against Liverpool, therefore we had to prepare an extremely robust case. “You’re talking a documentation bundle of probably in excess of 400 or 500 pages with witness statements, evidence, analytics about player performance, the statement as to why we make a judgment as to what we believe the player is worth, compared to what Liverpool want to offer.”
