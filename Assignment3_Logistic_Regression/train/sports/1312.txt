 Maria Sharapova lost more than her WTA Championships title to finish her 2005 schedule. She ended it not knowing how long it might be before she is fit enough to make amends. At least a 7-6, 6-3 defeat by Am√©lie Mauresmo in the semi-finals in Los Angeles spared the 18-year-old defending champion the tearful agony of her Wimbledon title loss four months ago.  Lindsay Davenport was also beaten, denying the tournament the finalist it most wanted. The world No1 lost 7-6, 7-6 to an impressively resurgent Mary Pierce, and in four WTA Championships in her home city Davenport has now failed to win any of them. She showed little regret that it is now moving to Madrid.
