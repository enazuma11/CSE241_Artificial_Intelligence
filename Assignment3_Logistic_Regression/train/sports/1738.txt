 Leicester City have signed Wilfred Ndidi from Genk for £15m, subject to a work permit. The 20-year-old Nigeria midfielder has agreed personal terms with the Premier League champions and signed a contract until June 2022. Ndidi, who will wear the No25 shirt, moved to Genk from Nathaniel Boys of Lagos after impressing during a trial and made his debut in January 2015 as a centre-half. He can also play at right-back and has been capped twice by Nigeria. He will join his international team‑mate Ahmed Musa at Leicester and both will be available during the Africa Cup of Nations because Nigeria failed to qualify.
