 Shortly after making history as the youngest Briton to play on the main WTA tour, Laura Robson settled into the more familiar role of an English tennis player by departing in the first round of the Fortis Championships in Luxembourg. Despite a positive start against world No42 Iveta Benesova, the 14-year-old lost in three sets 1-6, 6-2, 6-3. However, there was plenty of promise in her performance, especially at the beginning of the match. When she broke her opponent's serve in the second game, she went on to take the set with ease, prompting hope for a shock victory. But her dominance couldn't last and Benesova recovered to brush her easily aside in two further sets. Robson, the junior Wimbledon champion, was given a wild-card entry into the event after going into the senior rankings for the first time at No550 last week. She will now return to junior competition to prepare for the Australian Open in January and says she's in no hurry to break into the senior game on a full-time basis.  "I now know I can play with the women players but they have got so much more experience, so I will just work my way into the women's tour because there is no rush at all," she said recently. Elsewhere Jamie Murray and Swedish partner Robert Lindstedt progressed to the quarter finals of the men's doubles at the Grand Prix de Tennis de Lyon after a 6-0, 7-6 (9/7) victory over fourth-seeds Marcelo Melo and Andre Sa. The pair will face Thierry Ascione and Marc Gicquel in the last eight.
