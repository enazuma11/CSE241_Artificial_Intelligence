 Britain's top two women, Anne Keothavong and Katie O'Brien, will contest the main draw of the DFS Classic in Birmingham when it begins today.  Keothavong and O'Brien, ranked 96th and 112th in the world respectively, are the first Britons to gain direct entry into the annual pre-Wimbledon tournament since Sam Smith in 1999. Keothavong will arrive on a high having reached the final of the Surbiton Trophy at the weekend.  The former British No1 Elena Baltacha and the wild-card entry Naomi Cavaday, of Kent, are also in the main draw. Home interest is guaranteed in the second round with wild cards Melanie South and Anna Fitzpatrick facing each other in the opening round.
