 One of the best things that could happen to tennis would be for Marat Safin to return consistently to the form that enabled him to capture the 2000 US Open title - and at last there were signs of this yesterday as the charismatic Russian won his first Masters Series title for almost two years.  Safin outplayed David Nalbandi√°n in three straight - and very straightforward - sets, and although the match itself was disappointing because the capable Argentinian buckled under the weight of expectations - much as in the 2002 Wimbledon final - the outcome was encouraging.  Safin believes he is back. The heat with which he struck the ball burnt all his opponents, even the great Andre Agassi in Saturday's semi-final, and despite dropping serve to go 1-3 down in the second set, Safin's concentration and patience during a 6-2, 6-4, 6-3 win were markedly improved.  The 24-year-old attributes this partly to the presence of models as ballgirls, something he greatly favours as they "give you extra motivation". Less flippantly, Safin seemed to see his performance as a mystery. "I'm really surprised. I've not been playing great tennis and suddenly I play like this," he said.  Probably the presence of Peter Lundgren, once coach to Roger Federer, is helping instil the calm required to make this possible. The Swede could be heard at the end of the second set bellowing "one more set" - which may not sound like genius advice, but masterpieces of timing are sometimes needed to get imperatives into Safin's mind.  All this cranks up the pressure on Tim Henman, who is pushed down to seventh place in the ATP Champions Race by Safin's success. Agassi is now only 54 points behind and if this small gap is bridged over the next fortnight, Henman could be edged out of a place in next month's year-end finals in Houston. Safin, meanwhile, can hope for more "motivation" next year, as the tournament promoter Ion Tiriac said that he fully expects to employ models on court again in 2005.
