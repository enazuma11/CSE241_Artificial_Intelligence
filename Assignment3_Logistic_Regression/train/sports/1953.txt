 Tottenham’s dreams of a first league title in 55 years may have already been dashed by the time they kick off at Stamford Bridge on Monday. A disappointing draw at home to West Brom put the Premier League trophy on a silver platter for Leicester. If Claudio Ranieri’s side fail to win at Old Trafford, Spurs will need to get three points at the home of the reigning champions. However, Chelsea fans and players have expressed a desire to see their London rivals fail in their title pursuit so the Blues will be fired up for this match.
