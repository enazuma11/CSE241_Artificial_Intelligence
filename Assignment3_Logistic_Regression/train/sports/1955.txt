 Olimpija Ljubljana have decided against trying to bring in Harry Redknapp as manager because the club’s president Milan Mandaric believes it would be too much of a risk. The Slovenian league leaders were taken over by the former Portsmouth, Leicester and Sheffield Wednesday owner last summer and have been without a manager since Marijan Pusnik’s departure in December. Olimpija director Ranko Stojic last week confirmed surprise reports that the former Portsmouth, Tottenham and QPR manager was a candidate, saying Redknapp could head to Ljubljana if he decided against “an offer from the Arab world”. The relationship struck up between Redknapp and Mandaric during their time at Fratton Park was key to such a deal, but the president has decided against trying to bring him to the Stozice Stadium. “We cannot afford the slightest error because there is too much at stake,” Mandaric said on the club’s website. “We need someone for whom the Slovenian football environment is not foreign. It would therefore be pointless at this stage to engage experts from Western Europe. I know that there has recently been debate about the arrival of my good friend and former colleague at Portsmouth, Harry Redknapp. I can assure you that [it will not be him] because we cannot afford too many risks.”
