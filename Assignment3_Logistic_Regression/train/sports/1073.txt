 Andy Murray booked his place in the quarter-finals of the Morgan Keegan Championship last night with a comfortable 6-3, 7-6 victory over the Dane Kristian Pless. The world No13, who had defeated Frank Dancevic in the first round in three sets, is on course to meet the American Andy Roddick in the semi-finals. The 19-year-old Scot, who retained his SAP Open title in San Jose last week - beating Pless along the way - matched his achievement in this tournament last year by reaching the last eight. Having won the first game of the match, Murray had two break points in the second which he failed to convert. The set went with serve, even after a close tussle in the fourth which went to deuce. At 3-3 Murray held serve, then broke Pless and held serve to take the set. The second set was tighter and went with serve - Murray again wasting a break point in the third - as Pless went to 5-4. More wasted break points saw the set go to a tie-break. But Murray held his nerve to win 7-4 and take the match 6-3, 7-6 (7-4). Murray is now eyeing another potential last-four meeting with Roddick, the world No4. They met in the semi-finals in San Jose, where Murray claimed victory. Also winning through to the quarter- finals was Tommy Haas, who beat the American Amer Delic 7-6, 7-6. The German now faces a last-eight meeting with another American, Sam Querrey, who upset the French seventh seed Julien Benneteau 6-3, 6-4. "I think we both served well today and it was very close," said Haas. "It really just came down to a couple of tie-breaks. He almost came back in the second one, but it was a good win." Jamie Murray's emergence as a leading doubles player, meanwhile, was confirmed by victory for the Scot and his partner Eric Butorac over the top seeds in Memphis. Murray moved into the ATP doubles top 50 for the first time after he and Butorac beat the Israeli pair Jonathan Erlich and Andy Ram 6-4, 6-4 to reach the semi-finals.
