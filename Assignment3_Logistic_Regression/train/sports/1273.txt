 Britain's top three tennis players find themselves bunched together after the release of the latest ATP rankings. Andy Murray, ranked 44 in the world, is still ranked British No1, while Tim Henman and Greg Rusedski are at 45 and 46 respectively on the ATP list. Henman, up four places after reaching the quarter-finals in Dubai last week, is the only one of the trio to have risen in the rankings. Murray, beaten in the first round of Tennis Channel Open in Las Vegas, is down two places. Both Henman and Murray have played down the importance of being the British No1. Henman has said that "it is bizarre that we make such a big deal of who is number one in Britain". Murray, meanwhile, has labelled it "the bottom of my list of priorities". At this time last year Murray was ranked 415 in the world and No15 in Britain.
