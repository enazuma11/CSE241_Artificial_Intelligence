In this episode Will Macpherson and Vish Ehantharajah analyse the England v Sri Lanka series and interview Middlesex women’s captain Isabelle Westbury By Will and Vish, for Freelance Cricket Club, part of the Guardian Sport Network 
 Cricket just never sleeps. This week alone, England’s men have their third Test against Sri Lanka (they are 8-0 up in the Super Series, don’t you know?); England women have a new captain; Australia, South Africa and West Indies are playing ODIs in the Caribbean; and, in the county game, that relentless part of the season when they play every day has kicked in. Thus here’s a lot to talk about on this episode of the Freelance Cricket Club podcast, Will Macpherson and Vish Ehantharajah called in the services of a pair of two guests. Firstly, there’s Middlesex women’s captain, journalist, commentator and general everywhere-woman Isabelle Westbury to discuss the English women’s game, the upcoming (and inaugural) Kia Super League and the underrated importance of social media in the promotion of the game. Next up is Cricinfo’s Sri Lanka correspondent Andrew Fidel Fernando to discuss the tour so far and what we can expect at Lord’s. Fernando is one of just two Sri Lankan journalists covering the tour, and he gives insight into Durham centurion Dinesh Chandimal’s fascinating backstory, as well as the shambolic state of administration in Sri Lankan cricket. He explains why they started the series so badly and gives the inside track on why they are not scared of their destroyer-in-chief this summer, Jimmy Anderson. Also on the agenda are cricket’s desperate chase for context and an attempt to bust any nonsense about the scale of Anderson and Alastair Cook’s achievements in reaching 450 Test wickets and 10,000 runs respectively.
