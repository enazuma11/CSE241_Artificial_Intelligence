 The agency chose Eugène Delacroix's 1830 masterpiece Liberty Leading the People to laud the young tennis star, who narrowly lost to Jennifer Capriati in the final of the French Open on Saturday.  The painting depicts a bare-breasted woman clutching the French tricolore and a musket, and leading the masses forward to overthrow the Bourbon King Charles X in the revolution of July 1830.  The agency, All That Jazz, made several substantial alterations. It put the 18-year-old Clijsters's head on Liberty's shoulders, replaced the French tricolore with the Belgian, and scrawled Liberté, Egalité, Fraternité across the painting.  Then, to underscore the tennis connection, it crossed out Egalité (equality) and replaced it with Deuce.  The Belgian financial services group Delta Lloyd, which commissioned the ad, was delighted, and the reworked Delacroix appeared in full colour in every national newspaper in Belgium.  There was, however, just one problem: nobody had thought to ask Clijsters whether she was happy with the ad. Her father, Lei, was furious when he found out what had happened and is threatening legal action against Delta Lloyd unless his daughter receives financial compensation.  "Only Sanex and Siemens have the right to use her image," he told the daily La Dernière Heure.  Mr Clijsters has enlisted the sports management company IMG to fight his daughter's corner and discussions with Delta Lloyd are continuing.  Delta Lloyd is adamant that it did nothing wrong. "Our objective was to be a good supporter of Kim Clijsters at Roland Garros [the French Open]," its spokesman, Marc Stevens, said yesterday. "And to show that Belgian tennis is the best in the world. "Our lawyer said there was no problem because the painting was humorous and didn't say she was promoting our products. It was just a parody."  Mr Stevens made clear that Delta Lloyd was not willing to pay Clijsters. "To pay would be to recognise that we have done something wrong, and that is not the case."
