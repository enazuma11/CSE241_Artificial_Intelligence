 Stuart Broad has earned his first England one-day call-up since the 2015 World Cup after being named as Liam Plunkett’s replacement for the series with South Africa. Plunkett had been drafted into the squad after his fellow fast bowler Steven Finn’s tour was ended by a side strain in the third Test, only to suffer a thigh injury during the Lions series with Pakistan A. While Plunkett will remain with England’s second string for the remainder of their time in the UAE, he will fly to South Africa for the two Twenty20s that end the ongoing tour, provided he returns to full fitness. Broad, the world’s No1 bowler in Test cricket, has been pushing hard for a recall to England’s white-ball teams after losing his place in the aftermath of their failed World Cup campaign. Speaking last week, the 29-year-old reiterated his determination not to be pigeonholed as a Test specialist with the 2017 Champions Trophy and the 2019 World Cup both being played on home soil. “As a bowler you’ve got to stay mentally in the game with any format because injuries do happen and it is a tough sport and opportunities will arise,” said Broad, who has taken 177 wickets in 119 one-day internationals. “There is a lot of important white-ball cricket coming England’s way with the World T20, the Champions Trophy and then the 2019 World Cup, which I want to be involved in. “The dream of mine is to play in that World Cup and win it at home. That would be epic. I’m just looking to improve and I know I can make improvements in white-ball cricket, but I can also change games if given the chance.” England take on South Africa in five one-day internationals and two Twenty20s starting in Bloemfontein on 3 February. Their World Twenty20 campaign starts against West Indies in Mumbai on 16 March, with Finn still expected to be fit for the tournament.
