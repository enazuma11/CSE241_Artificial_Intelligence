 Big year for Michael Lumb. Signed to bring batting experience but only century last year came in the Pro40 Captain Dimitri Mascarenhas Coach Paul Terry 2007 Championship 5th (D1) Pro40 4th (D1) Friends Provident runners up Twenty20 6th in South group In Benny Howell (2nd XI) Out Shane Warne (ret), James Bruce (ret), Shaun Udal (Middx), Mitchell Stokes (released) Overseas Shane Bond (NZ), Shane Watson (Aus) Indian effect  Nic Pothas played in the ICL but has been cleared to play by the ECB. Captain Dimitri Mascarenhas will join the IPL next month for at least two weeks. Pinning their hopes on John Crawley, their most experienced batsman.

They have not got the bowlers to be competitive this season and their young batting talent has not got the depth to fill the gap left by Pietersen.
