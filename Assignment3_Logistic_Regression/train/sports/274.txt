 Both of today's Twenty20 quarter-finals have been postponed due to wet weather. Lancashire's home tie against Somerset and Hampshire's visit to Northampton have both been washed out and will now take place tomorrow, weather permitting. A torrential downpour at Old Trafford left the playing surface "resembling a lake", according to Lancashire. The game had already been postponed once due to rain and the club have had to ask for special dispensation from the England and Wales Cricket Board in order to play the match tomorrow. Steady rain at the County Ground in Northampton has also forced an abandonment. Sussex and Durham have already made the last four of the competition.
