 Ifthikar Anjum claimed five wickets as Pakistan turned in a clinical performance to secure a 146-run victory in the fourth one-day international against Sri Lanka in Colombo. Ifthikar claimed the key wickets of opener Upul Tharanga, Kumar Sangakkara and Thilan Samaraweera, adding Thilan Thushara and Lasith Malinga in the final overs to complete the haul. Off-spinner Saeed Ajmal and leg-spinner Shahid Afridi also chipped in with two wickets apiece as Sri Lanka were bowled out for 175 runs inside 37 overs. Umar Akmal had earlier raced to 102 from 72 deliveries - the 19-year-old's maiden ODI century - to ensure Pakistan made the best of good batting conditions to post an imposing 321 for five. Sri Lanka's chase under lights was undermined by the cheap dismissal of makeshift opener Mahela Jayawardene for 19, and although Sangakkara and Tharanga had a spirited 65-run stand for the second wicket, Pakistan exerted control with their spinners. Jayawardene, who had ensured Sri Lanka's series win with a century in the previous match, had begun with a superb cover-drive and had quickly progressed to 19 when he was lured into a hook shot by Naved-ul Hasan. Jayawardene, however, miscued and instead skied to Mohammad Aamer at fine leg. Sangakkara took up the chase and clubbed Aamer for three consecutive blows in one over even as he handled the other fast bowlers adroitly. But Ifthikar, who had leaked plenty of runs earlier, snared the Sri Lankan skipper although his delivery was innocuous. Sangakkara chipped straight to Imran Nazir at backward point, the stroke ending a 33-delivery innings. Sri Lanka's chase then unravelled as the middle-order crumbled under pressure from Pakistan's spinners.
