 Patriotism offers a year-round refuge for scoundrels, but provides a mental bunker for all sorts during Wimbledon fortnight. Not since Fred Perry's third win in 1936 has a male native claimed the crown. Yet 72 years on the excitement is, again, centring on a single Brit who might - just might - prevail. This year it's Andy Murray, a Scot who has a better shot than many past English so-called hopefuls. Henman hill has, inevitably, been rebranded Murray mound. The best insurance against disappointment is putting nationalism to one side. If the patriotic pull is too strong for that, it is wise to take solace in British achievements in the early stages, such as Chris Eaton's win on court three on Tuesday night, which the BBC failed to screen. Without good luck, this sunny 20-year-old wouldn't have been there at all. He won entry to the tournament in a qualifying contest he'd picked up a wildcard entry for. He has the lowest ranking of any Wimbledon competitor in years. Far from being intimidated, he dispatched three aces in his first service game. Another 23 followed before he locked up a three-set victory against Serbia's Boris Pashanski, who is ranked 547 places above him. Eaton, whose car's wing mirror is held on with masking tape, doubled his career earnings at a stroke, picking up Â£17,000 for the game. He lost in the doubles yesterday, and his odds of victory in his second-round fixture today are long. Whatever happens, it cannot detract from Eaton's hour of glory. Enjoy it while it lasts.
