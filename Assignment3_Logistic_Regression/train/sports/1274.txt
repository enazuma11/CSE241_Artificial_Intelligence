 Tim Henman won another match yesterday. It was only his third since Wimbledon and it was only against Taylor Dent, whose play can be all over the place and was for the first set here in the first round of the Masters Series. But at this stage of Henman's career it was like gold dust to win 6-2, 6-4 against the erratic American. "I was very happy with my level of play," he said. "I think it was a reflection of last week. I thought I played some similar tennis today and I was able to take my chances when I did." Henman is daring to believe that, after 15 months of aches and pains, his body now feels "amazing". His tennis was less so but did not have to be. The balls were hard to control and his opponent missed eight of his first 12 serves and sprayed volleys around as well. All Henman had to do was play sensibly. In the second set Dent's inconsistencies decreased and Henman had to save two break points, which he did with solid serving. In due course Dent offered him another chance of a break, with a stop volley which strayed into the tramlines, suggesting he was ready to go home. Henman competently clung to the advantage to earn the chance of revenge on Radek Stepanek, whom he faced five days ago at 2am, deep in the bowels of a 50-year-old stadium where a few faces were peering from odd corners and it was easy to imagine the squeezy old chords of The Third Man playing. They meet again tomorrow in the Rockodrome, where the ceiling looks like a spaceship, the ball flies like a rocket and people were still wandering in at 11 o'clock last night. That is the difference between Vienna and modern Madrid. Henman played more than well enough to have beaten the world No14 from the Czech Republic last time but somehow did not. He badly needs that to be different too.
