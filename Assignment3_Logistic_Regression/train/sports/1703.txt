 Galatasaray have named Mustafa Denizli, the only coach to win the Turkish league title with three different clubs, as their manager. Dursun Ozbek, the club’s chairman, made the announcement at a joint news conference after a meeting with Denizli at the club’s stadium in Istanbul. “It’s a great honour to be here. A difficult and challenging task is waiting for me now,” said Denizli. “I am excited to be back with the only club for which I would risk my successes, my reputation.” Denizli, 66, managed Turkey for four years and reached the quarter-finals of the European championship in 2000. He has won three domestic league titles with Istanbul’s three big rivals – Galatasaray, Fenerbahce and Besiktas. His previous spell in charge of Galatasaray was in the early 1990s. Last week Galatasaray parted ways with Hamza Hamzaoglu, less than a year after he took charge of the side, following a mediocre start to the season. Galatasaray are seven points behind the league leaders, Besiktas, in third place after 12 games and third in Champions League Group C on four points from as many matches. Denizli said he will not travel to Madrid for the team’s game against Atletico on Wednesday.
