The world No1 Roger Federer is the overwhelming favourite to retain his title in the first grand slam final to be played at night. The Australian Open is the one major the Russian women have yet to conquer but all that may well change in Melbourne, says Stephen Bierley. Tim Henman and Greg Rusedski will predictably carry British hopes at the Australian Open as Parmar and Bogdanovic fell at the final qualifying hurdle. Britain's No1 has put an end to his Davis Cup career and with it the country's expectation of success in the competition.
