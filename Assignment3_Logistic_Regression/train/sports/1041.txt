 Roger Federer, seemingly on cruise control this week, juddered a little in his final round- robin match of the Masters Cup against Carlos Moya. Moya, who in a couple of weeks will lead Spain in their Davis Cup final against the United States on clay in Seville, looked in sharp form but eventually succumbed.  Federer's 6-3, 3-6, 6-3 victory stretched his unbeaten run in this annual end-of-season event between the world's top players to eight matches, the world No1 having gone undefeated when he won the trophy here last year.  Moya, a former French Open champion, admitted that he did not find Federer as intimidating as he had Pete Sampras or Boris Becker because Federer was such a nice guy off court. "I'm not saying the others were not, simply that they did their own thing, whereas with Roger you can talk to him every day, and he talks to you."  On the court, however, Federer, the holder of three of the year's four grand-slam titles, is some way clear of the rest. A year ago Andy Roddick was the world No1; now he is playing catch-up.  Roddick's backhand is improving all the time and, as his coach Brad Gilbert promised, the American is now spending more time at the net - a virtual necessity given the power of his serve.  Roddick will never have the natural flair of Federer, who leads their head-to-heads 8-1, but there is no doubting his determination. "All my off-court work is beginning to show," he said. "It feels good out there."
