 Steven Finn and Jake Ball will miss the second Test against Pakistan at Old Trafford that starts on Friday England have left themselves the option of choosing Adil Rashid as a second spinner, for what would be his first Test on home soil, as they seek to battle back after losing by 75 runs at Lord’s. They appear more likely to name the spinner Moeen Ali in their final XI, alongside a four-man pace attack who are set to include Jimmy Anderson and the all-rounder Ben Stokes, both returning from injury. “We’re going to name a 12 – Steven Finn and Bally are missing out,” Alastair Cook said. “That means Ben Stokes and Jimmy Anderson are back in and Adil’s going to be in the 12, just depending on what happens to that wicket by tomorrow.” The Nottinghamshire bowler Ball had reported tightness in his left thigh during the first Test, in which he made his debut in the defeat by the tourists, while Finn suffered a prolonged spell of bad luck with the ball, failing to take a wicket. Rashid could be included at a venue known to favour spin. “I think he has got a chance,” the England captain added. “Again, it just depends what happens to that wicket over the next 12 hours. We want to have that option. It’s tough on Jake and Steven. Jake on debut bowled better than just taking one wicket.” Pakistan have eased fitness doubts about their match-winning leg-spinner Yasir Shah. He took a blow to his shoulder batting in the nets on Wednesday but scans showed no significant damage. The Pakistan captain, Misbah-ul-Haq, said: “That was a wake-up call for him. It was a bit of a concern but after the scan I think he’s OK. So no worries.” AN Cook (capt), AD Hales, JE Root, JM Vince, GS Ballance, JM Bairstow (wkt), MM Ali, CR Woakes, SCJ Broad, JM Anderson, BA Stokes, AU Rashid.
