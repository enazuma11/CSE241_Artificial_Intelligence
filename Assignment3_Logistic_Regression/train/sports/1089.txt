 Am√©lie Mauresmo, the winner of two grand slam titles, has ended her season and is considering retiring. "Since I came back from the US Open I have been trying to practise but I did not find the desire to get back to competition," the world No20 from France said. "I do not want to rush things," Mauresmo added. "I still give myself some time before making a decision regarding the remainder of my career." Mauresmo, 30, topped the WTA rankings in September 2004 and clinched her two grand slam titles in 2006 when she won the Australian Open and Wimbledon. She has collected 25 WTA singles titles since turning professional in 1993. She has not played competitive tennis since losing to Canada's Aleksandra Wozniak in the second round of the US Open.
