 Can we please have a modest round of applause for Heather Watson and Elena Baltacha, who made it through to the second round of the French Open earlier this week. It may seem a small achievement in the grand scheme of a Grand Slam tournament, but these two are breaking a 19-year drought for Britain; the last time two women made it past the first round at Roland Garros was 1992. Back then – well before the "Tiger" Tim years – it was Jo Durie and Sara Gomer carrying the weight of British expectation. Alas, both crashed out by the third round. You can't help but feel a little sorry for the female contingent of Team Great Britain; they haven't yet inspired the kind of mania that greets Andy Murray, the third team member to get through in Paris, or had a mound of earth named after them at Wimbledon, à la Henman. British number two Anne Keothavong had to put up with crowds turning their backs on her match to watch Roger Federer practise on the court on the other side. Perhaps unsurprisingly, she didn't make it to the next round. These women plug away at the game they love and still struggle to be household names. So let's hope these wins are a watershed, not least for Watson, who at 19 is the British number three. Like fellow young Brit Laura Robson, 17, she has a junior Grand Slam title under her belt, having won the girls title at the US Open in 2009. She is only the second Brit to do this – the other was Murray. Both Robson and Watson have been touted as future Top 100 players by the Lawn Tennis Association chief, Roger Draper. Remember, we didn't all fall instantly in love with Murray when he first appeared on the scene in 2005. And it took a couple of years before we allowed Henmania to sweep the nation in 1996. Perhaps a nickname would speed the process along for these young women? May I suggest Heather "The Hare" Watson and Laura "The Lynx" Robson, in tribute to their speed and agility? Any other thoughts?
