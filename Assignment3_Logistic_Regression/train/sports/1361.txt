 Venus and Serena Williams have become the first players to win four Olympic tennis titles after being crowned women's doubles champions at London 2012. Less than 24 hours after Serena joined older sister Venus as a three-time gold medallist with a crushing victory in the singles – completing the career golden slam in the process – the United States pair saw off the Czech Republic duo Andrea Hlavackova and Lucie Hradecka 6-4, 6-4. Sunday's match was a repeat of last month's Wimbledon final, which the Williams sisters also won in straight sets on Centre Court. The Americans broke serve in the very first game under a closed roof and, although they were forced to save more than one break-back point, they held on to take the opening set. Hlavackova and Hradecka had chances to break early in the second set before dropping serve themselves in game five, and the Williams pair never looked back to record a straight-sets triumph.
