 Andy Murray celebrated his premature elevation to No1 in the world – after Milos Raonic’s surprise withdrawal through injury from their Paris Masters semi-final – with an exhibition hit-up against his coach, Jamie Delgado, in front of a bemused capacity crowd in the Bercy stadium. It was a curious but strangely fitting coronation for someone blessed with natural humility, although not the one fans or Murray were expecting. It brought to an anti-climactic conclusion a campaign that has been building momentum over the past month, as Murray went on an unbeaten run of 18 matches while claiming titles in Beijing, Shanghai and Vienna. The walkover against Raonic lifts him five points clear of Novak Djokovic, who lost to Marin Cilic in the quarter-finals on Friday. Asked how it compared with winning three slams or the Davis Cup, Murray struggled to put his historic achievement in context. “It’s quite different because the slams, you obviously prepare for them. It comes quite quickly, the result, in the space of two weeks. It’s unfortunate the way that it happened. I would have liked to have done it on the court, but it’s been many years of work to get here. Especially at this stage of my career, as well … so it’s more satisfying in some ways. “It’s been such a difficult thing to do because of how good the guys ahead of me have been. Even this year, to even be there for one week and be 20 points ahead, or whatever, I have had to win so many matches and get to the latter stage of pretty much every tournament I have played. “They [Djokovic, Roger Federer and Rafael Nadal] are three of the best players that have ever played the game. Some of the years that they have had in that period have been ridiculous, really – three slams, double slams and many Masters series, as well. So it’s taken a great year to get there.” Murray said he spoke to his mother, Judy, and his wife, Kim, and the former British No1 Tim Henman, but had not had time to go through any other messages of congratulations. With another prized bauble to go alongside his three majors, the new world No1 will reach for one more title in the final on Sunday, against John Isner, who beat Cilic 6-4, 6-3 in an hour and 11 minutes – quite a turnaround for the Croat, who put Djokovic out of the tournament to provide Murray with a smooth path to the summit of his sport. It is fair to say a semi-final against a fit Raonic would have been tougher than will be the final against Isner, whom Murray has beaten in all of their seven matches. As Murray said, jokingly: “I’m not sure this is right in the rules but, if I get defaulted in the match tomorrow, I don’t think I get the points from this week. So I need to make sure I’m on my best behaviour, keep my racket in my hands, and all will be well on Monday. “I need to reset what it is I’m trying to achieve. Hopefully, I’ll feel good for that. I had a similar experience last week in Vienna with [David] Ferrer withdrawing before the final.” Murray said that Raonic told him – and totally by accident – about pulling out. “I was in the locker room watching some videos of Milos’s match yesterday when he came into the room where we were. I kind of, like, quickly closed the iPad. Then he told us he had hurt his quad and he wasn’t going to be able to play. “I felt quite calm, just because of the nature of how it happened. I didn’t really react. My team were a bit different, gave me a hug and chatted about it.” Whatever his sympathies for Raonic, Murray will take the break anyway it comes. “I never expected to do what I had done after the French Open,” he said, reflecting on his loss to Djokovic in the final. “I was really down after I lost that match. But things can turn around quickly in sport. You had Novak losing yesterday to a guy he won 14 times in a row against. And then John beating Cilic today who he’d lost six in a row against.” Raonic, who lost to Murray in the final of Wimbledon this year, said: “Yesterday at 4-2 in the first set I started feeling some pain in my leg. This morning I had trouble waking up and getting out of bed. So I did some tests, an MRI. They found that I have a grade one tear in the right quad.” Congratulations @andy_murray for reaching the pinnacle of our sport- #1!!! And that's not a hash tag- that is #1:). 👍 Asked if it endangered his participation in the ATP World Tour Finals in London, which starts on Monday week, Raonic said: “Yes, it does. I still have the possibility of making it, but I was told five to 10 days. So I’m on the borderline for that.” If, as seems almost certain, Raonic does not make it to the starting line at the O2 in north Greenwich, Tomas Berdych, whom Murray beat on Friday, will join the final eight.
