 Greg Rusedski set his sights on the Stella Artois Championship at Queen's next week after being outplayed by a Canadian teenager, Frank Dancevic, in the quarter-finals of the Surbiton Trophy.  The British No2 had scored two satisfying victories on the Surrey grass after suffering four defeats since being cleared of a drugs charge in March.  But the tall, nimble Dancevic proved too athletic and sharp for Rusedski and won 6-4, 7-6.  "I played better than in my two previous matches," said Rusedski. "But I paid for one poor service game in the first set and it was just a few points here and there in the second.  "It is harder than I thought coming back and I'm not as young as I used to be. But I still feel pretty good and I'm looking forward to Queen's."  Dancevic, 19, now meets the South African Wesley Moodie for a place in the final.
