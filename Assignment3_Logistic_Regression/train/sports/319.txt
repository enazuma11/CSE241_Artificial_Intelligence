 An inquiry is under way into reports that a Sri Lankan cricketer tried to open the door of a London-bound flight while the plane was at 10,000 metres (35,000ft). It is believed that the unnamed player tugged at the door for two minutes mistaking it for the toilet, with the Daily Mail reporting that one of the 229 passengers aboard the British Airways airliner described the incident as "pretty frightening". The alleged incident happened as the Sri Lanka A team flew to Gatwick from St Lucia on Monday after playing the West Indies. The player's board, Sri Lanka Cricket, said: "Further to the media reports relating to an incident that took place today involving a Sri Lankan player, Sri Lanka Cricket (SLC) wishes to announce that it is disappointed to hear of such an incident and SLC will discuss with the manager of Sri Lanka A team. "An inquiry will be conducted based on the manager's report and disciplinary action will be taken on the player concerned if found guilty." BA said on Tuesday: "There was a minor incident on board the BA2158 service from St Lucia to Gatwick involving a customer who we believe had been drinking. "It is impossible to open an aircraft door when it is at high altitude and at no point was the aircraft in any danger. Our cabin crew are highly trained to deal with such incidents and offered reassurance to customers who were sitting near to the door."
