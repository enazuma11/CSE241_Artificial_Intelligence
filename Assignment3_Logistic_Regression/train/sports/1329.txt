 Heather Watson battled back from losing the opening set to beat Yanina Wickmayer 3-6, 7-5, 6-3 at the Miami Open, in a hard-fought third-round match that lasted more than two and a half hours. Watson had pulled off a shock victory over 20th seed Sloane Stephens of the USA in round two but was soon trailing Wickmayer 3-0 in the opening set on. The world No69 rallied to hold serve and then force a break of her own. Wickmayer moved 40-0 ahead on Watson’s next serve and quickly converted the break-back chance to move 4-2 ahead. Watson recovered again to break, as neither player produced confident service games, then failed to hold herself. The Briton had lost all three of her previous contests with the 26-year-old Belgian and the second set continued with some erratic serving from both women. Watson needed to dig deep to retain her serve but she moved 6-5 ahead and went on to level the match. The momentum was now back with her, although the deciding set followed serve until Watson was able to break to lead 5-3. This time she made no mistake to book a meeting with Romania’s Simona Halep.
