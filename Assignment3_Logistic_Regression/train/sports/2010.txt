 Roger Federer is unlikely to make the same mistake as in 2002, when he was stunned in Wimbledon's first round after taking lofty Croat Mario Ancic for granted. It was the last time the five-times champion Federer lost here and it taught the world No1 a lesson he will remember when he meets Ancic in the quarter-finals today. "I completely underestimated him when I played him. I got completely surprised. He played well till the very end. I was a little shell-shocked and didn't know what happened to me," said Federer, who has beaten Ancic in all their five meetings since. "What it taught me was not to underestimate any opponent, no matter where they're from, what technique they have, what ranking they have. I think I had a tendency to do that sometimes, when guys maybe didn't have the proper technique or were new on tour, to not give them the respect maybe they deserved." Ancic, three years younger than Federer, was only 18 when he put the Swiss out. He is unseeded after suffering a bout of glandular fever which put him out of action for six months in 2007. He reached a highest ranking of seven in 2006. Ancic said: "I can sit here and tell stories about how great the win was and how I beat Roger Federer but actually it wasn't Roger Federer as we know him today."
