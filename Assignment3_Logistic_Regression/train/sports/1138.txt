 Serena Williams does not often publicly admit negative thoughts but yesterday in a swirling wind she did not really want to be playing an ambitious Wimbledon junior champion out on the graveyard of seeds, the dreaded Court Two. The sixth-seeded younger Williams sister overcame Urszula Radwanska 6-4, 6-4 even though the gremlins had been popping up in the American's mind. "I felt like I was a little tight out there and just didn't want to go out on Court Two," Williams said, and hinted at her state of mind by contradicting herself. "I never really think about that but it did kind of cross my mind. I was excited to get the first set under my belt."  So was Virginia Ruano Pascale, the Spaniard who once beat top-seeded Martina Hingis in the first round and who now took the first set from Am√©lie Mauresmo before the 2006 Wimbledon champion recovered with verve to win 4-6, 6-1, 6-1. Her French compatriot Marion Bartoli, also won, a 6-2, 7-5 success against Tatiana Perebiynis.
