 As Davis Cup draws go, it doesn't come much easier. Great Britain have avoided a tricky trip away to the likes of Morocco or Venezuela and will instead face Thailand in their World Group qualifying tie for next year's tournament. The tie, which will decide whether or not Britain stay in the top-16 of world tennis, is at home in September against one of the Davis Cup's weaker teams. Thailand have one world-class player in Paradorn Srichaphan, who is ranked 67th in the world, but their number two player Danai Udomchoke is ranked only 241st in the world, with Britain's top six players all ranked above him.  No wonder Great Britain captain Roger Taylor was a relieved man after the draw today, telling reporters: "I think we have been fortunate and have come out of the draw very well. It would be fair to say that we are favourites and it is a good draw for us."  The choice of venue has yet to be decided, but Birmingham's National Indoor Arena is the favourite to stage the tie from September 20-22.  Taylor added: "At the end of September it might be difficult to take it outdoors if the choice of surface was grass, so I think we will be looking at playing indoors and there is no secret that Birmingham would be one of the venues we would consider.  "That would be on a fast indoor court that suits us best and means we can take full advantage of the home draw.  "I see a lot of Srichaphan on the circuit and he is a good strong player and is moving up the world rankings. I don't know their number two or three players so I will have to find out more about them." The other ties to decide which teams are promoted to the world group for 2003 see Australia at home to India, Zimbabwe at home to Belgium, Brazil at home to Canada and Venezuela drawn away to Germany. Finland will entertain Holland, Slovakia are to home to Romania and Morocco will face Switzerland.
