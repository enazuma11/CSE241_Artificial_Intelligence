 Laura Robson is to enter the main draw of the French Open next month. The former British No1 is ranked at 465 but is using her protected ranking of 58 following her long absence with a wrist injury. Robson had surgery in April 2014 and her progress has been frustratingly slow but the 22-year-old is now free of pain. Her only two victories this season were in qualifying for a small tournament in the United States, with her last tour-level win coming way back in September 2013. Robson, who last played at Roland Garros in 2013 and has never been beyond the first round, joins the Australian Open semi-finalist Johanna Konta, Heather Watson and Naomi Broady in the women’s singles. Broady’s only previous grand slam appearances have come courtesy of Wimbledon wildcards but the 26-year-old goes straight into the main draw after reaching No79 in the rankings. The world No2 Andy Murray is joined by Aljaz Bedene and Kyle Edmund in the men’s singles, making seven British players in the singles draws, the most at Roland Garros since 1985. Like Robson, the former US Open champion Juan Martín del Potro and the Australian youngster Thanasi Kokkinakis are using protected rankings but Maria Sharapova’s name was missing when the entry lists were released on Thursday. The two-times champion is currently serving a provisional suspension pending a hearing after testing positive for meldonium at the Australian Open. The International Tennis Federation confirmed that Sharapova’s hearing will go ahead, although the date will not be made public. The World Anti-Doping Agency changed its guidance this week after admitting it is unclear how long meldonium stays in the body. That has potentially opened the door for some of the more than 170 athletes who have tested positive for the drug to avoid sanction.
