 The thought of having to milk a cow may have put Wimbledon champion Roger Federer off his stroke yesterday as he squeezed through to a 6-3, 6-7, 6-3 first-round win over the Spanish qualifier Marc Lopez at home in Switzerland, 48 hours after lifting the top trophy in tennis.  For Federer's reward for his Wimbledon triumph from a grateful Swiss nation came in the form of a cow, presented to him on court at the country's Open tournament here where he is the top seed.  "When they brought in the cow, I couldn't believe it. I wasn't expecting any presents - and certainly not a cow. But she is fantastic.  "I'm not often in the company of cows. I was afraid that she might bite me, but I think she liked it when I stroked her. I hear they also like to lick salt out of your hand."  As would befit a working farm village - albeit one where formula one's big cheese Bernie Ecclestone owns a top hotel and uses the only jet runway in this part of the Bernese Oberland to arrive and depart at his leisure - the good life in Gstaad means the dairy life.  All Swiss cows in this part of the Alps are named at birth and given the traditional bell. As a result, Federer now finds himself the proud owner of Juliette, a prime 800kg specimen who should yield untold years worth of cheese and farm-fresh milk for the pleasure of this country's first-ever men's grand slam champion.  Juliette will stay at her home in this peaceful alpine region while all of the cheese her milk eventually produces will go straight to the Swiss star's home in Basle.  Federer also tried out a traditional one-legged Swiss milking stool in front of his new friend, whose head was wreathed in garlands of mountain flowers. He is due to perform her regular 5pm milking today.  To learn that particular skill, Federer need look no farther than fellow competitor, Alex Corretja, a three-time champion who has actually done the deed in Gstaad. "I'll take him up to the mountains and show him how it's done," said the Spaniard.
