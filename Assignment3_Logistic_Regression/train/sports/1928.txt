 Francesco Totti came off the bench to make his 600th league appearance for Roma as they beat in-form Chievo 3-0 at home on Sunday to climb to second place in Serie A. The victory moved Roma up to 77 points with one game left in the race for the second automatic Champions League berth, one ahead of Napoli who play Torino later on Sunday. The Chelsea target Radja Nainggolan slammed home the opener in the 18th minute before Antonio Rudiger doubled the home side’s lead with a 39th-minute header. Miralem Pjanic added a third when he was picked out by an excellent pass from the 39-year-old Totti and he finished calmly past Albano Bizzarri. Totti, whose future at the club beyond the end of the season remains uncertain, was introduced as a 59th-minute substitute for Mohamed Salah and the club’s beloved captain received an emotional ovation in what may be his final match at the Stadio Olimpico.
