 Am√©lie Mauresmo was asked if she felt overlooked as the defending Wimbledon champion after quietly reaching the third round with a 6-1, 6-2 win over Austria's Yvonne Meusberger yesterday. The Frenchwoman had plenty of reasons for feeling that she has been ignored. Mauresmo's reception on her return to the All England Club on Tuesday was quirky, taking place in a half-empty and roofless Centre Court, and for her second match she was whisked out to Court No2, the graveyard of champions. "Well I was sure you were going to ask me that," she said when asked if it had concerned her. "I started the championships last year on this court. Of course, you always want to play on the big courts, but I'm fine on court two. It didn't bother me." As for being overlooked, she sounded as if she might even prefer it. "I'm going through my matches the way I want to," she insisted. She was, she agreed when the words were given to her, just flying under the radar.
