 The rise and rise of Russia's women will surely produce a grand slam champion before long and yesterday Maria Kirilenko, the latest player of rich talent to emerge from that country, pushed Serena Williams, the 2002 French Open champion, to the brink of defeat. Williams eventually won 4-6, 6-2, 6-4 in a minute over two hours, the 17-year-old having led 4-2 in a tense final set.  There was no doubt whose side the crowd were on and a few boos rang out when Williams won.  Kirilenko, who made her grand slam debut at Flushing Meadows last year, reaching the third round, played with supreme assurance in the first set, stunning Williams with her ground strokes. Before Roland Garros Williams had played only four tour naments this year after knee surgery in August.  She won her comeback at Key Biscayne in April but since then her form has been patchy, including a semi-final defeat by Jennifer Capriati in the Italian Open this month. She was controversially seeded No2 here, her ranking having dropped to No7.  Her sister Venus, who had earlier beaten Croatia's Jelena Kostanic 6-3, 6-3, was watching Serena struggle, as was their mother, Brandi. Venus appeared anxious when Kirilenko broke in the third.  It had seemed that Serena had turned the match round in the second set. But, if she thought it was effectively over against Kirilenko, ranked a lowly 100, she was badly wrong and it took a massive effort to win.  More, perhaps much more, will be heard of Kirilenko.
