 Serena Williams lent credibility to her boast that she still has what it takes to win grand slam titles, by reaching her biggest final for a year and bringing an entire arena to its feet. This was the same stage where last year she complained of offensive remarks from a spectator and had him ejected but last night, as she beat Svetlana Kuznetsova 3-6, 7-5, 6-3 in a hot struggle lasting 167 minutes, she was just about everyone's favourite. It was not a great performance - there were too many mistakes for that - but there were patches where both women played very well, with Williams producing the kind of unstoppable trademark blows that have helped her win all four grand slam titles. It followed her victory over the world No1, Justine Henin, in the quarter-finals and raised the possibility that she can make a successful defence of this Masters Series title tomorrow, adding impetus to her long-term aim of returning to the top and being No1 again herself. But last night she said: "I was disappointed with some aspects of my performance. I made some errors but I corrected them and went on rather than dwelling on them. The win was built a lot on being mentally tough and playing the right shots at the right time, and never giving up."  Williams claims she is moving better than at any time since winning the Australian Open 15 months ago. Perhaps, but she is still not as fit as she would like to be, twice receiving treatment for what looked like a lower-back problem. But she did return serve well and sought to move forward more than she once did. She will meet Jelena Jankovic or Vera Zvonareva in tomorrow's final.
