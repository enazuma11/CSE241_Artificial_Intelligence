 Etienne de Villiers, the new president of the ATP, wants the men's calendar pared back, more prize money and more stars.  As if on cue comes the 20-year-old Cypriot Marcos Baghdatis, who yesterday reached the last 16 of the Australian Open for the second successive year.  Baghdatis is a wonderfully ebullient character who radiates immense enjoyment whenever and wherever he plays, and in this city he has acquired a loyal throng of fans who roar his every winning point.  "I feel like I am at home," he said. "I have 21 cousins here from my Lebanese father's side and I have uncles here too. I love the atmosphere and I love the fans. They are crazy and make me feel very, very comfortable.  They help me play my best tennis and feel really confident."  Baghdatis plays Andy Roddick, the No2 seed, tomorrow.
