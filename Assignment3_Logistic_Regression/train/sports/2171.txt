 Top seeds Venus Williams and Belgian Justine Henin today won their semi-finals to advance to tomorrow's final of the Australian women's hardcourt championships. Williams, the US Open and Wimbledon champion, led Nadia Petrova 7-6 6-5 before the Russian withdrew with a shoulder injury.  World number seven Henin, who lost to Williams in last year's Wimbledon final, beat seventh-seeded Czech Daja Bedanova 6-2 6-2.  "I'm not scared about playing her," the second seed and defending champion Henin said of Williams. "The pressure will be on her. I know I have the game to match her. I'm not the same player that I was at Wimbledon."  The powerfully-built Williams said she respected Henin as an opponent. "She's a great player and I will certainly have to be on my toes," the 21-year-old American said.  World number one Lindsay Davenport's chances of being fit in time for this month's Australian Open in Melbourne suffered a set back today when she was forced to withdraw from the tournament's main warm-up event in Sydney due to her persistent knee injury.  Sydney international tournament director Craig Watson said Davenport's injury, which caused her to pull out of the WTA Championship final against American Serena Williams in November in Munich, had not fully healed.  "It is obviously very disappointing to lose Lindsay," said Watson. "She is a great player, a great personality, a lovely person to deal with and someone who is very popular with the fans."  Watson said that although Davenport would miss the January 6-12 Sydney event, the American was confident of being fit for the Australian Open - the first Grand Slam of the year - starting in Melbourne on January 14.
