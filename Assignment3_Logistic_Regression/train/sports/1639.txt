 Michael Di Venuto showed Australia what they are missing when he tormented his old county Sussex with a career-best 254 not out for County Championship leaders Durham. Australia have been reduced to using an all-rounder, Shane Watson, at the top of the order in the third Test, but opener Di Venuto had a day to remember at the Riverside while his struggling countrymen were perhaps happy to have their third day washed out at Edgbaston. The 35-year-old Tasmanian, who played a few matches for Australia's one-day team in 1997, moved on from his overnight 141 and hit 35 fours and a six from 368 balls in Durham's 473 for four before they declared shortly before tea. Dale Benkenstein chipped in with 69 in a fourth-wicket stand of 173 with Di Venuto. Sussex were 119 for one in reply, with Michael Yardy unbeaten on 54. Somerset and Nottinghamshire are the two teams most likely to have a chance of preventing a second successive title for Durham and, after a late start and further interruptions at Taunton, the hosts declared on 401 for eight, with Zander de Bruyn top-scoring with 74. In reply, Nottinghamshire reached 77 for three. White Rose misery extended into "Yorkshire Day" at Old Trafford, where the hosts reached 219 for two from an overnight 106 for one in reply to Yorkshire's paltry 181 all out on a rain interrupted day. Australian-born opener Paul Horton led the assault for Lancashire with 84. Bad weather prevented any play in the other derby match, between Warwickshire and Worcestershire at New Road. In Division Two, a prompt start for leaders Kent against second-placed Derbyshire at Canterbury did the hosts few favours as they moved from 49 for one to 249 for eight in reply to 303. Seamer Graham Wagg bagged five wickets with only James Tredwell (67no) providing any real resistance. Bottom club Middlesex are on top against Northamptonshire at Lord's. Tim Murtagh took the one wicket they needed, for no addition, to dismiss their opponents for 288 and then Nick Compton (82) and Sam Robson (75) put on 167 for the first wicket. At the end of play, the Londoners had reached 310 for six, with Eoin Morgan hitting 71. Monty Panesar was wicketless after nine overs. At The Oval, Leicestershire teenager James Taylor recorded a maiden double-hundred and finished on 207 not out as the visitors piled up 593 for five declared at tea against Surrey. Jacques du Toit weighed in with an unbeaten 123-ball hundred. But rain prevented any further play. Following a long delayed start at Bristol Gloucestershire captain Alex Gidman added only eight to his overnight score of 122 in a total of 400 for nine declared against Glamorgan, who reached 35 for none at stumps.
