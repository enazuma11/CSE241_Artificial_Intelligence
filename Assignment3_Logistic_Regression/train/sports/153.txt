 Matt Prior may be unwanted by England as a wicketkeeper, but a year after his Test debut brought a century against West Indies he chose to remind the men at Lord's of his batting credentials. His century yesterday, a second of the season, gave the reigning champions a total to bowl at today. Without his 131 and a seventh-wicket stand of 142 with Robin Martin-Jenkins, Sussex would have been in a pickle. Prior went to the crease at 33 for four - it was 75 for six by lunch - and he left it six overs after tea at 274 for nine. Until he attempted to paddle Graeme Swann, he was little troubled by a wicket which had provided so many demons to others. The last time these two sides met in the championship, Mushtaq Ahmed took nine second-innings wickets, giving Sussex their 2006 title and consigning Nottinghamshire to the Second Division. Yesterday Mushtaq was wrapped up in the pavilion when Darren Pattinson, Nottinghamshire's Grimsby-born Australian import, got down to work. Last week he ran through Lancashire for a career-best six for 30. Yesterday, Sussex's batsmen seemed intent on a re-run. Chris Nash played over a ball he turned into a yorker, Mike Yardy played loosely at a ball which seamed, and Chris Adams was caught at first slip as he aimed towards mid-wicket. Against other bowlers, Carl Hopkinson skied an attempted pull, Murray Goodwin cut into the hands of point and Luke Wright lobbed limply into the covers. However, after the lunch break Prior and Martin-Jenkins - in their different ways - put the pitch into perspective. Prior - all pulls, cuts, and hooks - accelerated to a century off 115 balls, hitting 18 boundaries. Martin-Jenkins eased his way to 44 before attempting to plant Swann in the almost-finished new stand.
