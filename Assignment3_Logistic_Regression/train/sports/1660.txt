 A Brisbane man has been jailed for a week in Sri Lanka after streaking across the cricket pitch during Australia’s first Test in Pallekele. Alex James was also fined 3,000 rupees (A$28) for his public exposure – an offence under Sri Lankan law – after he invaded the deserted pitch during the washed-out final session of the opening day’s play.

He climbed over the boundary fence and once in the middle, stripped down to spend some time using the slick surface to indulge in some solo slip-and-slide entertainment. Cricket Australia reported that at no point did security guards or officials at the Pallekele stadium interrupt James’s fun and before long put his shorts back on and returned to his place on the viewing hill. He was arrested before leaving the stadium and spent the night in prison before being bailed the next day. He later returned to Kandy magistrates court, according to Cricket Australia.  Australia finished day one well on top before the hosts Sri Lanka hit back on the second day to leave the first of the three-Test series intriguingly balanced.
