 Lindsay Davenport described herself as 'happy, excited and eager' on the eve of Wimbledon after picking up her 33rd career title in Eastbourne, but it's hard to know just how good the world number three actually is.  Davenport was so dominant in the final two rounds of the Britannic Asset Management championships that her status as fourth-favourite for Wimbledon behind Venus Williams, Martina Hingis and Jennifer Capriati looks a shade understated. In yesterday's final she beat Magui Serna, the Spaniard enjoying the best phase of her career, 6-2 6-0 in just 43 minutes.  Yet it might be unwise to read too much into this result. Serna is a rare breed, probably the only one of the 26 Spaniards in the singles main draws this coming fortnight who professes to love grass. Her fluent serve, sliced backhand and scurrying round the court mean she comes into her own on grass. She is probably the best of the Spanish women on the surface.  But yesterday her serve was erratic, her slice kept missing, and a very nimble Davenport made Serna look sluggish around the court. She started nervously and was broken in the first game of the match by a sizzling Davenport backhand, but after holding serve for 1-2 the Spaniard's nerves should have settled down.  That they didn't was due largely to Davenport's sustained accuracy off both wings. Serna looked impressive in the fifth game of the first set which she won to love on the only occasion she got her serve to work. But after that she looked a class below the 1999 Wimbledon champion.  After winning the first set in just 22 minutes, Davenport identified a problem with her troublesome right knee, and called for the trainer. Yet it was only to restrap the brace holding her kneecap in position, and any hopes that Serna harboured of imposing herself on the second set evaporated the moment it became clear Davenport's movement wasn't in any way affected. In particular, the tactic Serna used effectively all week - that of dropshotting her opponent and moving in behind it for an easy put-away - was foiled every time by Davenport's speed around the court.  At 25th, Serna was the highest-ranked player Davenport has faced this week, and the jury must still be out on how the American will fare against a fellow top-tenner. She looked very rusty against Silvia Farina-Elia in the quarter-finals, but having dropped the first set she finally found her form and has subsequently played six impressive sets.  'When I'm short of match practice I lose the sense of where my opponent is going to play the ball, so I'm slow reacting,' she said on Thursday, but by yesterday she was saying the rhythm was well and truly back.

Third seed Johansson, unbeaten in 10 matches, is emerging as a strong outsider at Wimbledon, where he is seeded eleventh.
