 Guus Hiddink has admitted Chelsea could become embroiled in a relegation battle if they lose to Everton and Arsenal in their next two games. The champions are 14th after 21 games, 12 points off their stated target of fourth place and only six clear of Sunderland, who occupy the final relegation place. Chelsea’s predicament prompted José Mourinho’s departure last month and Hiddink’s appointment. The team are unbeaten in six games since Mourinho’s departure, when they were one point off the drop zone, but the midweek draw with West Bromwich Albion did little to ease concerns. “It’s reality,” Hiddink said. “We were down when we started. We were one point off the relegation line, but now we have a little bit more room to breathe. “We have two difficult games coming up – Everton, who have a very good away record – and then Arsenal. If you don’t gather points there, you don’t know what the others do. The Premier League can surprise you. “There are 12 points difference to fourth place, which is Tottenham. We all like to look forward and to the top of the table, but also don’t be unrealistic – you’re six points off the line of relegation. That’s also a fact. “We have to work hard and be very concentrated and gather our points to step up. That’s why it was a pity that in the 86th minute we got this draw against West Brom, which would’ve helped us a lot to go up.”
