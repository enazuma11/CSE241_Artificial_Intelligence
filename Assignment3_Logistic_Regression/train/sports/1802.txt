 Stiliyan Petrov is planning a return to professional football and is hopeful of re-signing for Aston Villa having made a full recovery from acute leukaemia. The 36-year-old former captain has been training with the club’s Under-21s in recent months and has told the club, who have already been relegated to the Championship, that he is prepared to return at the beginning of pre-season. Recent fitness tests have revealed that he is close to the level before his enforced retirement in 2013. “I have decided to start trying to play football again at a higher level again,” Petrov told the Birmingham Mail at the launch of his golf foundation day at the Belfry. “Aston Villa remains my priority. “I am very excited. People will be asking a lot of questions, and will have a lot of doubts.” Petrov was diagnosed with the condition four years ago and despite believing he has a “good shout” at making a successful return, understands that there will be many doubters. Before playing for the club’s Under-21s, Petrov turned out for Wychall Wanderers in the Central Warwickshire league. “I always believe that if you work hard, you will get fitter,” he added. “My fitness is getting close to when I retired, so let’s see where we go.”
