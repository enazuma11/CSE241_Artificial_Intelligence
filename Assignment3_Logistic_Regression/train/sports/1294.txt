 Wimbledon got underway on time today despite heavy thunderstorms overnight.  Eleven millimetres of rain fell in the capital, but play on the outside courts began on schedule at noon, despite the threat of further showers. Defending champion Lleyton Hewitt starts his defence against the 6ft 10in Croatian Ivo Karlovic on centre court at 1pm, while bookies favourite Andy Roddick starts the proceedings on court one against Davide Sanguinetti of Italy. Hewitt's girlfriend Kim Clijsters, the No2 seed in the ladies' tournament, follows him on centre court before Brazilian Gustavo Kuerten returns to action after a two-year absence against unfancied Dutch player John Van Lottum. British interest begins today with Greg Rusedski, fresh from his victory in Nottingham, third on court one's bill against Alexander Waske, while British No3 Arvind Parmar takes on Holland's Sjeng Schalken, the eighth seed who took Lleyton Hewitt to five sets in last year's quarter-finals, on Court 13. In other notable ties today, Venus Williams begins her campaign to claim the title back from her sister Serena against Stanislava Hrozenska, the second match on court two and the men's fourth seed Roger Federer plays the Korean Hyung-Taik Lee next on the same court. However, play has started with the threat of a players' boycott hanging over next year's tournament due to a dispute over prize money. Leading players from the ATP are in disagreement with the organisers of the four Grand Slam events about the amount of the profits from the tournaments set aside for prize money and a boycott next year could see players such as Tim Henman and Greg Rusedski missing from the action.
