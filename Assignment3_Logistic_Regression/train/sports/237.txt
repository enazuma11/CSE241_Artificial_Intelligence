 The dates of England’s autumn series against Pakistan in the United Arab Emirates have finally been published. England’s summer programme concludes with a Twenty20 against Australia on 13 September and they arrive in the UAE on 30 September for a nine-week trip. The tour begins with a pair of two-day warm-ups and a three-match Test series in Abu Dhabi, Dubai and Sharjah. Four day/night one-day internationals follow between 11-20 November, with three Twenty20s rounding off the visit. With another three-format tour of South Africa following in December, England may be tempted to rest key men given the hectic nature of their playing schedule. Negotiations over the make-up of the tour had dragged on unusually long but England will be glad to begin with the Tests rather than white-ball cricket. Their subsequent winter tour of South Africa kicks off with four Tests and the England and Wales Cricket Board was keen to avoid playing all seven of those matches in a short period. “We are pleased to have agreed the schedule for this series with the Pakistan Cricket Board,” said the ECB chief executive, Tom Harrison. “Our last tour to UAE saw Pakistan win the Test series while we were victorious in both the ODI and T20 series. We expect this autumn’s tour will be equally hard fought and we trust that as many England fans as possible will make the trip to UAE to show their support for the team.” 30 Sep England team arrive 5-6 Oct Two-day game v Pakistan A (Sharjah) 8-9 Oct Two-day game v Pakistan A (Sharjah) 13-17 Oct 1st Test (Abu Dhabi) 22-26 2nd Test (Dubai) 1-5 Nov 3rd Test (Sharjah) 11 Nov 1st ODI (Abu Dhabi) 13 Nov 2nd ODI (Abu Dhabi) 17 Nov 3rd ODI (Sharjah) 20 Nov 4th ODI (Dubai) 23 Nov T20 warm-up v UAE XI 26 Nov 1st T20 (Dubai) 27 Nov 2nd T20 (Duabi) 1 Dec England depart.
