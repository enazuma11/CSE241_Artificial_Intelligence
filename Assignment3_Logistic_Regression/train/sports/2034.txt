 Andy Murray has been drawn to face former world No1 Marat Safin in the opening round-robin tie of the Kooyong Classic in Melbourne. After winning his fourth career title at the season-opening Qatar Open last week, Murray comes into the invitation-only tournament in top form and is aiming to use this week's event - which features five of the world's top 10 players - to complete his preparations for the Australian Open. Also in the top-class field are Russian Nikolay Davydenko, American Andy Roddick, Chilean Fernando Gonz√°lez, Argentinian David Nalbandian and Ivan Ljubicic of Croatia. World No1 Roger Federer was forced to withdraw from the tournament with a stomach virus, and has been replaced by Cypriot Marcos Baghdatis, while German Tommy Haas also pulled out after failing to recover in time from a shoulder surgery. Murray said a tough fitness regime during the off-season that included classes of Bikram yoga - performed in a room of 41C (106F) - would stand him in good stead for the Australian summer. "This year I had pretty much five weeks of training, so I feel physically much stronger," he said. "Tennis-wise it doesn't feel a whole lot different but I think being physically stronger helps you mentally as well." Now ranked ninth in the world, Murray will be aiming to better his fourth-round effort at last year's Australian Open when he lost a marathon five-set thriller to Spaniard Rafael Nadal.
