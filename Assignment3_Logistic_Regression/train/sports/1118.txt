 Maria Sharapova closed in on the world No. 1 spot when she reached the Rome Masters semi-finals with a 6-2, 6-2 win over Elena Bovina yesterday. The 18-year-old Wimbledon champion, the top seed here, will replace Lindsay Davenport at the top of the rankings if she triumphs this week.  Earlier, the defending champion Amélie Mauresmo crushed the four-times former winner Conchita Martínez 6-1, 6-2 to set up a last-four clash with another Russian, Vera Zvonareva, who edged out Francesca Schiavone 7-5, 7-6.  Sharapova was rarely stretched by the ninth seed. She simply outgunned her compatriot, moving her around the court with low, flat ground strokes and firing back return winners to break in the sixth and eighth games and take the first set. Having saved three break points early in the second, Sharapova lashed a return down the line to go 4-2 up, then held to close out the contest.  The tussle between Mauresmo and Martínez failed to live up to its billing.  The 33-year-old Spaniard, who won the tournament four times in a row between 1993 and 1996 but is now ranked 47th in the world, was out of her depth against the second seed, who stayed on course for her fifth final in six years in Rome. Martínez lacked power and precision on her ground strokes and made a string of mistakes.  "I think my opponent today had some ups and downs," Mauresmo said. "The first three or four games of the match were very important. She had some opportunities early in the first set, which she didn't make, and then I was able to break her first and play some great tennis." Reuters
