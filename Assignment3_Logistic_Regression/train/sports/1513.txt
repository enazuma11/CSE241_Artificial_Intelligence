 After a draw last week against the students at Fenners, the Sri Lankans gained the first win of their tour yesterday. For this success they have to thank a measured four-hour unbeaten 90 from the opener Michael Vandort that provided the bedrock of their run chase. That there was a match at all was down to the benevolence of the Derbyshire captain Graeme Welch, who declared his second innings closed after overnight rain had delayed the start. It left Sri Lanka requiring 262 to win in 60 overs and they were on course once Vandort and Upul Tharanga added 60 for the first wicket inside 11 overs. Tharanga was bowled for 39 by Mo Sheik and later Kumar Sangakkara and Jehan Mubarak fell to the spin of Andy Gray and Ant Botha respectively. Not for nothing though are Sri Lanka previous World Cup winners: run chases against the clock are their forte. While Vandort continued to accumulate, Tillakaratne Dilshan blazed briefly for 21 before Chamara Kapugedara hammered an undefeated 44 from 45 balls. Vandort may have gone some way to solving the conundrum of who opens the batting in the Tests in the absence of Marvan Atapattu, who is not touring due to a back injury, and Sanath Jayasuriya, who has retired from Tests. He is a tall, leggy left-hander, much given to the front foot, and he plays straight in defence and on the drive. He is tidy off his hips too and although he looks more at home as a restrained character there were a couple of meaty clumps over the legside ring and two resounding pulls to the midwicket boundary off Welch. The Sri Lanka coach Tom Moody is expecting a barrage of short stuff during the Test series, and for this he may have Vandort in mind. Plunging forward at Derby is one thing but doing so against Flintoff and co is quite another. With a match to negotiate later in the week against England A, he might just be saying farewell to half-volleys for a while.
