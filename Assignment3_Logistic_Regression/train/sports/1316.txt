 The good news for Tim Henman, having lost the chance of being seeded in the top five at Wimbledon after early defeat at the Stella Artois championships, was that he avoided the champion, Roger Federer, and the No2 seed, Andy Roddick, in his quarter when the draw was made at the All England club yesterday.  However, if he reaches the quarter-finals he could play David Nalbandian, who holds a 4-1 career advantage. Henman's only win came in the fourth round last year, and he rates the 22-year-old Argentinian, a surprise runner-up two years ago on his Wimbledon debut, as one of the toughest opponents.  "David is exceptionally quick, and rarely seems to hit a bad shot," said Henman, who opens up against the Spaniard Rubén Ramírez Hidalgo.  As the draw was being made the police said that security would be tighter than ever. The numbers of Metropolitan police have been significantly increased and all spectators will be subjected to extra searches.  Greg Rusedski, beaten at Nottingham yesterday by Thomas Johansson, will open up against a qualifier and might then play Rainer Schüttler, the No 8 seed.  Of the eight British men in the draw, all of them wild cards except for Henman, the No5 seed, the plum coupling went to Alex Bogdanovic. He will make his centre-court debut against Federer. Bogdanovic, 20, was awarded a wild card despite losing the financial backing of the LTA recently.  The Williams sisters, Serena and Venus, have been kept apart in the women's singles, raising the possibility of a third successive all-Williams final.
