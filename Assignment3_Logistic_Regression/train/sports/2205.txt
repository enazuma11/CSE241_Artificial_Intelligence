 Maria Sharapova, the new world No1 after Justine Henin's retirement, looked anything but a potential French Open champion yesterday, coming within a couple of points of losing her opening match to Evgeniya Rodina, 19, making her first appearance in the main draw of a grand slam. In the gusty wind, Sharapova struggled on serve against her fellow Russian, sending down 17 double faults before eking out a 6-1, 3-6, 8-6 win after nearly 2 hours. No women's top seed had lost in the first round here since the sport went professional 40 years ago.  "Sometimes you have these days when nothing is working for you," said Sharapova. Serbia's Ana Ivanovic, the world No2, reached the third round with a 6-1, 6-2 victory over Lucie Safarova of the Czech Republic.
