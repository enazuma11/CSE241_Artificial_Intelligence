 Showers have postponed the start of play in Australia’s World Cup clash with Bangladesh at the Gabba on Saturday. The match was scheduled to start at 1430 AEDT. But organisers are still hopeful of play getting underway with showers expected to ease. The Gabba has been hit hard by rain since Friday as tropical Cyclone Marcia moves down the Queensland coast. Organisers say the toss will not be taken until the rain stops. They are hoping a match will be held due to the Gabba’s famous drainage, even at the minimum allowed 20 overs a side. The deadline for a final call on whether a match will get underway is 2030 AEDT. There are no reserve days for pool matches. A washout would delay Australian captain Michael Clarke’s comeback from hamstring surgery. Australia delayed the naming of their XI for the Bangladesh clash due to the wet weather. If points are split for a no result in Brisbane, there will be more pressure on Australia to defeat New Zealand in their next match in Auckland on February 28. A loss would put them on course for a semi-final showdown with the highly fancied Kiwis at Eden Park on March 24.
