 Rain has trimmed this match down like a bonsai tree, with 61 overs lost in two days. But even in miniature Sussex look like champions and Matt Prior made the cold and damp gloriously bearable with one of his finest innings. He was unbeaten on 57 when play started at 2.45pm, with Sussex 213 for seven, and he went on to complete his 16th first-class century and his fourth against Kent. When he bats like this he leaves his wicketkeeping rivals behind him - at least in front of the stumps. There was command, and a controlled aggression against pace and spin that was reminiscent of Mike Gatting, which is praise indeed.  He reached his hundred from 169 deliveries but his second fifty came from only 73. He used his feet against pace as well as spin and danced down the pitch to drive Azhar Mahmood through midwicket for his 12th and final four to reach 98.  Prior got to his century when he glided the same bowler down to third man for three and it was a surprise when he was caught behind, pushing forward to Azhar. His eighth-wicket partnership of 76 with Ragheb Aga gave Sussex the platform to reach 300 and a third batting point. Kent were soon in a mess at five for two, Robin Martin-Jenkins taking the wickets with consecutive deliveries. Both Joe Denly and Martin van Jaarsveld were trapped on the crease, the latter for his second golden duck in three innings. They lost their third at 20 when Matthew Walker was caught in the gully by Carl Hopkinson, their fourth at 53 when Darren Stevens found the same fielder, their fifth at 58 when Neil Dexter was lbw to Mushtaq Ahmed and their sixth at 64 when Robbie Joseph went likewise.
