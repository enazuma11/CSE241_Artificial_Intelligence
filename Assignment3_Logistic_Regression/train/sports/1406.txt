 He might not have a reputation as the world's most charismatic player, but Wisden today unveiled the South Africa allrounder Jacques Kallis as their leading cricketer in the world for 2007. The stats are hard to argue with. In nine Tests last year Kallis scored 1,210 runs at an average of 86, and at one stage hit five centuries in seven innings - three of them helping South Africa achieve a famous series win in Pakistan. Throw in 20 wickets at 25 each, as well as a one-day average of 58, and the decision seems hard to argue with. Peter Roebuck, arguing Kallis's case, says he "has emerged as the first indisputably great African cricketer of the post-apartheid era". But should an award that has previously been made to Ricky Ponting, Shane Warne, Andrew Flintoff and Muttiah Muralitharan be reserved for a player who transcends cricket's primary requirement of runs and wickets? Or are we falling into the trap of condemning one of the game's most remorseless performers for an apparent lack of on-field spark? And does that matter anyway? Roebuck says Kallis "has assisted in the rise of his team and the reassurance of a country that invests in sport". But do you think he deserves the accolade? And if not, then who?
