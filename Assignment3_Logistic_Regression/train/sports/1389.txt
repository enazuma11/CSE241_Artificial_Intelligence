 The former England seamer Andy Caddick is to retire from all forms of cricket at the end of the season, 19 years after making his Somerset debut. The 40-year-old played 62 Tests, taking 234 wickets at 29.91, and took 69 wickets in 54 one-day internationals. He is eighth in the list of all-time England Test wicket-takers. Caddick has been a consistent performer with Somerset since his last international appearance, in 2003, and was the leading English wicket-taker in 2007. However, injuries plagued him for much of last season and the beginning of this one. The New Zealand-born bowler has so far taken 1,175 first-class wickets. His career-best figures are nine for 32.
