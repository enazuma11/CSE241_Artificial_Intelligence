 Somerset's coach Andy Hurry had asked his team to extend their lead to more than 250 on the deteriorating Tunbridge Wells pitch and although a Marcus Trescothick century helped them to set Kent 271 to win in five sessions and a handful of overs, they would have been disappointed not to have had more.  Kent, who at stumps had reached 134 for five, with Joe Denly 64 not out, took Somerset's last five wickets for 49 after they had advanced the overnight score from 157 for two to 270 for five at lunch, when Trescothick was unbeaten on 133 and Ian Blackwell had made 48.  Robbie Joseph and the second new ball did for Blackwell, however, caught at second slip for 61 with the score on 286. Three overs later Trescothick was leg-before to Ryan McLaren for 139, which included 19 fours and a six. The pair added 107 for the sixth wicket. With the total on 310, McLaren accounted for Craig Kieswetter, caught behind for one, which brought Ben Phillips in to join Pete Trego. The former Kent players added 25 before Phillips was bowled by Yasir Arafat, who also accounted for Charl Willoughby first ball as Somerset were all out for 335. Essex were asked to chase 445 at Chelmsford, where Leicestershire improved their overnight 233 for three to 449 all out, Hylton Ackerman finishing on 112 and Paul Nixon an undefeated 92, and reached 69 for one. Ryan ten Doeschate was the pick of the Essex bowlers, with five for 58 off 19 overs.  At Swansea Glamorgan were asked to follow on after making 278, Jamie Dalrymple contributing 82 of them, when chasing Northamptonshire's 531 for eight declared while at Edgbaston Warwickshire finished their first innings on 438 and a lead of 141 over Middlesex, who had almost knocked that off for the loss of one wicket, reaching 124 with Owais Shah and Billy Godleman (56no)still at the crease. At Sabina Park Australia had advanced their total to 372 for seven at lunch on day two of the first Test with West Indies, Ricky Ponting being dismissed for 158.
