 Roger Federer was in imperious form in the second round of the Australian Open. The No2 seed took just 1hr 27min to dispatch Evgeny Korolev 6-2, 6-3, 6-1. The Swiss player, looking to win his 14th grand slam title, was rarely in trouble against the young Russian and will now face the No26 seed Marat Safin, a winner in Melbourne in 2005, in the third round. Safin also breezed through today with a straight-sets victory over Spain's Guillermo Garcia-Lopez.  Novak Djokovic's defence of his Australian Open title remained on track, with the No3 seed easing in to the third round with a 7-5, 6-1, 6-3 win over Jeremy Chardy of France. Chardly, the rapidly improving world No68, went toe-to-toe with his Serbian opponent in the first set, before Djokovic broke serve in the 12th game. The second and third sets were far more one-sided, however, with Djokovic taking the second in just 23 minutes and racing into a 4-0 lead in the final set before, briefly, being pegged back. The 2008 champion will face Amer Delic in round three. The American came from two sets down against the No28 seed Paul-Henri Mathieu of France, winning 1-6, 3-6, 6-3, 7-6, 9-7. The American Andy Roddick eased his way into the third round with a 4-6, 6-2, 7-6, 6-2 win over the Belgian qualifier Xavier Malisse. Roddick, seeded seventh, began slowly but seized control of the match when he won the third-set tie-break. David Ferrer showed no illl-effects from his five-set win over Denis Gremelmayr in the opening round, becoming the first man into round three with a comfortable win against the experienced Slovakian Dominik Hrbaty. The No11 seed eased to a 6-2, 6-2, 6-1 victory against the former world No12 who came through qualifying to make the main draw. Ferrer faces the No19 seed Marin Cilic in the third round. The in-form Croatian, who won in Chennai earlier this month in his only tournament this year, needed four sets to beat Janko Tipsarevic 6-2, 6-3, 4-6, 6-3. The No15 seed Stanislas Wawrinka beat home favourite Brydan Klein in straight sets and their were also emphatic wins for Tomas Berdych, the Czech No20 seed, and Tommy Robredo. The Spanish player dropped only four games on his way to victory over Viktor Troicki.
