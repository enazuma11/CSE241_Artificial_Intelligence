 Andy Murray booked a place in the third round of the St Petersburg Open with a 6-2, 6-4 win over Lukas Dlouhy of the Czech Republic. Murray dominated his rival's serve in the opening set and he overcame a testing start to the second to win inside an hour and 10 minutes.  The 20-year-old got off to a scintillating start, breaking Dlouhy in the first game of the match before taking his own service game in resounding fashion, including a first ace, to take an instant 2-0 lead. The next four games went with serve as the match settled down before Murray took two in succession, including a second break to take the set 6-2.  Dlouhy was under pressure again at the start of the second set but this time held his first game before stunning the Scot to complete a break of his own and go 2-0 up. A second held serve put Murray three games behind but a fine comeback from the British number one was in the offing.  At 4-2 Dlouhy double-faulted at game point and allowed Murray to fight back, earning a break to make it 4-3 before holding serve to draw things level. Murray then continued his fine counter-attack, breaking again as his opponent's serve again let him down before closing the second set 6-4 ahead to progress.
