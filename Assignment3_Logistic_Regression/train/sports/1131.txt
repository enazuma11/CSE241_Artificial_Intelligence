 Maria Sharapova extended her unbeaten run to 14 matches yesterday by winning her second title of the year with victory over compatriot Vera Zvonareva in the Qatar Open. The world No5 took the final set in little more than 20 minutes, with a sudden trampling sequence which allowed her fellow Russian only eight points, carrying the Australian Open champion to a 6-1, 2-6, 6-0 triumph.  "I found something which got me going," Sharapova said. That appeared to be a couple of scrambling rallies which she won, creating a little extra adrenalin, and once on top, Sharapova's overwhelming power and intensity was unstoppable, as Zvonareva acknowledged.
