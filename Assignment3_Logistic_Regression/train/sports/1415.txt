 Ed Joyce hit a century as Sussex moved top of Clydesdale Bank 40 Group A with a resounding eight-wicket win at Worcestershire. The visitors went into the match two points behind Middlesex at the group's summit and took control of the game from the moment Chris Nash removed Jack Manuel for 48 to end a second-wicket stand of 97 with Vikram Solanki (51). Worcestershire collapsed from 109 for one before that wicket to 217 for seven in their 40 overs, Mike Yardy and Rana Naved-ul-Hasan taking two wickets apiece, and Joyce and Nash quickly made inroads. The pair put on 153 before Nash fell for 61 from 55 balls and, after Lou Vincent was also dismissed, Joyce (101 not out) pressed on in company with Murray Goodwin (39no) to seal victory with more than 10 overs to spare. Derbyshire beat Kent by 31 runs after Martin Guptill (102) and Greg Smith (68) powered them to 249 for nine despite Azhar Mahmood and Wahab Riaz combining for seven wickets. Darren Stevens hit 65 off 52 balls for Kent and James Tredwell added a plucky 37 down the order but Jonathan Clare took three for 61 as the visitors were bowled out for 218. An outstanding unbeaten 84 from Zander de Bruyn helped the Group B leaders Surrey to a tense win over Warwickshire at Guildford. Rikki Clarke smashed 76 against his former county as the Bears posted 225 for eight, Yasir Arafat taking five for 45. Surrey slipped to 160 for six before De Bruyn was joined by Zafar Ansari. The young left-hander crashed 22 from 16 balls in a stand of 48 and De Bruyn and Chris Schofield (13no) saw Surrey home with seven balls to spare. Northamptonshire failed to make any ground on the top two as they were well beaten by Leicestershire at Grace Road. Nadeem Malik took three for 37 as Northants were restricted to 206 for six, Stephen Peters (63) and Andrew Hall (67) rescuing them from 45 for four with a partnership of 91. Josh Cobb paced Leicestershire's chase with 91no, rounded off by the winning boundary, while opening partner Andrew McDonald hammered 35 from only 19 balls. Nottinghamshire cut the gap to the Group C leaders with a 19-run win over Gloucestershire at Cheltenham. The opener Alex Hales slammed 61 from just 32 deliveries, with 10 fours and two sixes, to set the tone and Samit Patel (45), Riki Wessels (37 from 24 balls), Scott Elstone (36) and Paul Franks (28no) lifted Notts to 266 despite James Fuller and Jack Taylor taking three wickets apiece. Ian Cockbain hit 79 but Gloucestershire never threatened the target, limping to 247 for nine as Luke Fletcher took three for 39. Lancashire cruised to victory after bowling the Unicorns out for 179 at Colwyn Bay. Junaid Khan took four for 29 as only Michael Thornely (47) and the wicketkeeper Josh Knappett (42) offered much resistance for the part-timers. Lancashire made untroubled progress, the openers Stephen Moore (40) and Tom Smith (35) putting on 58 before Steven Croft (59no) and Karl Brown (42no) finished the job.
