 Andy Murray will look to resume a spirited comeback against Janko Tipsarevic tomorrow after rain ended play prematurely on the second day of the Stella Artois Championships. As the dark clouds drew in, the Scot was 5-2 up and on the brink of drawing level against his Serb opponent having finally found his rhythm following an erratic opening. A series of errors combined with some impressive attacking shots from Tipsarevic saw Murray lose the first set 7-3 on a tie-break. Earlier the patchy Scot had blown an early break to fall a break behind himself, and then had to save three set points on his own serve in the ninth game in order to keep the set alive. The second set started brighter for a re-invigorated Murray and he broke Tipsarevic at the first opportunity before racing into a 5-2 lead courtesy of some powerful ground strokes. However, Tipsarevic held break point as the rain began to fall and Murray will have to hold both his serve and his nerve to take the match into a third set.
