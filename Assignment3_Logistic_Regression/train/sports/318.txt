 Click to enlarge, and debate the strip below the line. 1) Out obstruction. The ball becoming lodged like that does not mean it isn't still live. As such, the batsman has no right to touch it unless he's specifically been asked to do so by a member of the fielding side. Thanks to Jeff Houseman. 2) You have to be absolutely certain that it was the ball, not the shoe, that broke the wicket. If you can't be sure – and it's hard to see how you could be – then the batsman cannot be given out run-out. Instead, you would call and signal dead ball as early as possible in the process, to make it clear that no run-out or run-scoring was now possible. Ross English wins the shirt. 3) A clever piece of play. With the fielder merely diverting the ball on to the wicket, this has to be a run-out. For a catch to be awarded, you must be certain that the catcher has held on to the ball, then had full control of his further movement with the ball in hand. This was a deflection, not a catch.
