 The A-League and W-League finals will be patrolled by even more sets of eyes after Football Federation Australia announced goalline officials will preside over the matches. The decision comes after Sydney FC coach Graham Arnold implored FFA to bring in fifth and sixth officials following a string of high-profile errors from referees. The extra officials will be positioned at either end of the field to assist referees with decisions in and around the penalty area including penalties and goals. A-League head Damien de Bohun said goalline referees had been involved in getting crucial decisions right when they were trialled in the FFA Cup. “The technical standard and speed of play in the A-League goes up every season and this places additional demands on match officials,” de Bohun said. “Referees continue to improve as well thanks to additional coaching and fitness programs but in the split-second available to make decisions in and around the penalty area the extra set of eyes is extremely valuable.” The outspoken Arnold used a post-game press conference on 3 January to make a plea for more whistleblowers. “My opinion is they have to put in goalline referees immediately,” Arnold said after Sydney FC’s 2-2 draw with Melbourne City. “If you had goalline referees, another two sets of eyes, it can help.” Referee Ben Williams apologised publicly for two howlers in a 0-0 draw between Adelaide United and Western Sydney on New Year’s Day, while Central Coast striker Roy O’Donovan remained on the field after headbutting Manny Muscat, an act which later drew an eight-match suspension. “The reason I’m speaking out is because it costs coaches jobs,” Arnold said. “If you have goalline referees, they’re there, they can see everything.”  FFA has also made a submission to Fifa about a trial of video replays to assist officials.
