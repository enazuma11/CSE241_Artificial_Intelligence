 Greg Rusedski's best winning streak of the year came to an end in the Stella Artois Championship today. Rusedski won consecutive matches for the first time this season to set up a third-round clash with fourth seed Radek Stepanek at Queen's Club. But the British No2 went down in straight sets, 6-3, 7-6. He served three double faults to lose his opening service game of the match but after breaking back when Czech star Stepanek served for the match at 5-4 in the second set, he lost the tie-break 7-4.
