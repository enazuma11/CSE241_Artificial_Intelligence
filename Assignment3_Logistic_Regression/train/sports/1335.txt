 Tim Henman reached the final of the ABN/AMRO World Tennis Tournament in Rotterdam for the third time in four years with an emphatic win over the Croat Ivan Ljubicic. Henman, forced out of the Marseille event the previous week because of a stomach virus, showed no lingering effects with a 7-5 6-4 victory that put him within one victory of his second title of the year after his win in Adelaide in January.  Seeded sixth, Henman put the towering Ljubicic under pressure from the start, earning breakpoints in the third and fifth games. Although Ljubicic served himself out of trouble on those occasions with his booming serve, Henman kept up the pressure by moving forward whenever possible.  His perseverance eventually paid off at 5-5 when he followed up two winning cross-court volleys with a superb backhand down the line to capture the break. He then held to go a set up.  The Croat stayed on terms in the second until the ninth game, when a double fault and two unforced errors handed Henman three breakpoints. Having saved the first two with huge aces, Ljubicic hit a simple cross-court wide to hand Henman what was to prove the decisive break.  Â· You've read the piece, now have your say.
