 Andy Roddick crashed out of the US Open in the first round when he lost in straight sets on his 23rd birthday. The former champion was beaten 7-6 (7/4), 7-6 (10/8), 7-6 (7/1) by unheralded world No68 Gilles Muller at Flushing Meadows. Roddick, seeded fourth, had no answer to the Luxembourg player, who matched the 2003 champion shot for shot. But Muller's variety of tactics proved decisive as he consistently pounded his left-handed serve wide to Roddick's backhand - notching 24 aces - and confused his opponent with drop shots, blistering groundstrokes and well-placed volleys. Roddick's vaunted big serve kept him in the match, but he could not turn the tide against Muller, who was unruffled by playing in his first US Open. "I don't really remember a loss where I've felt this bad afterwards," said Roddick. "This is the first loss I've had like this where I felt great going in. Twenty-four hours ago, I was really optimistic about my prospects here. I'm in a little bit of shock right now, to be honest." Meanwhile, Roger Federer had little trouble as he embarked on his defence of the US Open title with a comprehensive first-round victory against Ivo Minar. The world No1, who beat Lleyton Hewitt in last year's final, progressed past his Czech opponent with a 6-1, 6-1, 6-1 victory. "I'm really pleased with the way I played," said Federer. "I was returning very well, hardly giving him any points there, holding easy on my serve. I didn't expect it because, in the first few rounds, usually I struggle a little bit early on, but I managed to play consistently.
