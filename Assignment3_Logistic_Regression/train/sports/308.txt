 Sam Robson and Adam Lyth scored centuries before retiring in England Lions’ first-day run-fest of 361 for four against an inexperienced Gauteng Invitation XI in Soweto. In a match also notable for Jonathan Trott’s return to England colours since the 2013 Ashes Test in Brisbane, Robson, who made 109, was quicker into his stride than Lyth, who reached 106, after the Lions were put in at the start of their tour-opening three-day match. Robson, who achieved a maiden Test century against Sri Lanka at Headingley for his adopted country in June only to finish the season less convincingly, reached three figures this time from 146 balls – having hit 12 fours and a six. He dominated an opening stand of 176 with Lyth. The Yorkshireman will be one of those pushing hardest alongside Robson to open with the captain, Alastair Cook, against New Zealand and in the Ashes. After England’s World Cup schedule, a first full international chance to press those claims may come in three Tests against West Indies in April and early May. Lyth did his prospects no harm by following Robson to a century, his from 168 balls but featuring significant acceleration after taking 129 over the first 50 and going on to hit 15 fours and a six in all. Trott, who has gradually returned to form after his much-chronicled difficulties with a stress-related illness, is the captain of the Lions but could not begin his tour with significant runs – falling for six, caught behind by his opposite number Sizwe Masondo off the teenager Keith Dudgeon, who has played only one first-class match. Just after evening drinks, James Vince was only the second authentic departure – caught at cover off Nono Pongolo – but Lyth’s fellow Yorkshire left-hander Alex Lees stayed put from No3 to pass a 112-ball half century. In an unbroken stand of 86 with Jonny Bairstow, Lees finished on 82 not out – having survived one early chance to short leg.
