 Pete Sampras, winner of 14 Grand Slams and arguably the greatest player in the history of tennis, will announce his retirement on Monday. According to his representatives, IMG, Sampras will make the announcement at the Arthur Ashe Stadium prior to his appearance at a special ceremony that kicks off the US Open in Flushing Meadows, New York.  The serve-and-volleyer has not played competitively since he defeated long-time rival Andre Agassi in four sets to win last year's US Open. The world's top-ranked player for most of the 1990s, Sampras has won 64 singles titles and has earned more than Â£27million in prize money. He has won five US Opens, seven Wimbledon championships and two Australian Opens.  "While collecting these honours, he's thrilled millions of fans across the globe with his prowess on the court and grace off of it," ATP chief executive officer Mark Miles said "His passion for excellence and dedication to success make him a model athlete that will be celebrated for generations to come. Sampras may be retiring from professional tennis, but his legacy will carry on."  The 6ft 1in Sampras turned 32 last month. He and his wife, actress Bridgette Wilson, had their first child, Christian, last November. Sampras won his first Grand Slam title at the 1990 US Open. "He was just one of the most graceful players of all-time, one of the most quietly competitive people of all-time," said Andy Roddick, leader of the ATP Champions Race and the man many consider to be the most likely to fill Sampras's boots. "When I think of him, I think of him as one of the best pressure players of all-time. It seemed like the bigger the match was, the better that he played."
