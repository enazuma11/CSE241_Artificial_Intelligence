 Former Newcastle assistant Mark Jones will return to the A-League club as head coach after signing a two-year deal. Jones, 50, takes the role following the shock sacking earlier this month of Scott Miller. Fellow Novocastrian Clayton Zane, who had been overseeing the team since Miller’s departure, has been named as Jones’ assistant. Jones was an assistant coach at the Jets when they won the championship in 2008 and played for Newcastle in the 1980s and ’90s, while Zane had also held an assistant’s role at the club and coached their W-League side. “It is no secret that this is a position that I have long coveted, and to realise my ambition of becoming a head coach in the city I love is a dream come true,” Jones said. “But now the hard work begins. The club has assembled a competitive and balanced squad brimming with local talent. “I am personally excited to work with each and every member of the squad.” Jones leaves his position as Adelaide United W-League and youth coach to move to Newcastle. The Jets were sensationally left without a coach a month out from the start of the A-League season when Miller was fired in early September after a falling out during a pre-season trip to China. Zane, a former Socceroo, will take charge for the Jets’ pre-season match against Western Sydney on Saturday in Cessnock.
