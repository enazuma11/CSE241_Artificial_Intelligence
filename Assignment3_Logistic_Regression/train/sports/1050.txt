 An plan to introduce tennis's first World Cup is to be considered by the top male players, reports the Times. In an attempt to attract younger fans, the biennial 10-day event, involving 32 teams, would feature shorter matches during which players have to watch the clock between points â€” and, most striking of all, compulsory mid-match substitutions. Although the format is in its early stages of development, it has already been presented to tennis administrators and television companies, who believe that a men-only competition would attract a bigger audience. Such a move could do serious damage to the popularity and credibility of the Davis Cup. Britain's Andy Murray has welcomed the idea, provided that the World Cup did not become an extra event on the men's tour. "I am a great fan of the Davis Cup, but if a decision was taken to drop it, or something else could change in the calendar, then a World Cup is a fascinating idea," said Murray.
