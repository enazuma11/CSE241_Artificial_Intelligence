 This week, host Geoff Lemon is joined by a trio of respected cricket writers: the Guardian's very own Russell Jackson, along with Gideon Haigh and Adam Collins. The team kick things off by taking a look at some of the best games (read contests) of the past seven or so days, including some impressive performances from associate nations Ireland, UAE, Afghanistan and Scotland. Just don't call them plucky underdogs. Next under the microscope are Sri Lanka, the team who were written off after their poor warm-up performances in New Zealand but, since their opening defeat, have been cruising along nicely, most recently evidenced by their destruction of England. Will Australia be the team to put them in their place? The podders then boldly attempt the impossible – making any kind of sense out of a crazy match at Eden Park between the co-hosts New Zealand and Australia – before they turn their focus onto West Indian masterblaster Chris Gayle, although not everyone was left in awe of his record-breaking double century. And to wrap things up, the team gaze into their crystal balls and attempt to divine what lies in the immediate future of the tournament.
