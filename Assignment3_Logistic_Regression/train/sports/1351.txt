 A tennis referee whose career was almost ended by a charge that she murdered her husband with a coffee cup has been reinstated after the charge was dismissed for lack of evidence. Lois Goodman's attorneys said Friday in Los Angeles that the US Tennis Association approved her to resume judging matches in 2013. The organization confirmed her reinstatement. She was suspended after her arrest last August while preparing to work as a line judge at the US Open. Prosecutors dropped the murder case November 30, saying they had received additional information and were unable to proceed because of insufficient evidence. Goodman had been accused of bludgeoning her 80-year-old husband to death with a coffee cup. She said she was innocent, and her lawyers suggested Alan Goodman died in an accidental fall.
