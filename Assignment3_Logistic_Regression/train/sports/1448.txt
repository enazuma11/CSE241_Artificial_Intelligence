 Shoaib Akhtar's 18-month ban for indiscipline has been lifted by the Lahore high court, according to court officials, pending a full and final judgement on the case. The suspension means that he is, once again, eligible to play for Pakistan. The R7m ($101,000) fine imposed upon him, however, will still stand. "Shoaib is now free to play for his country," said Shoaib's lawyer Abid Hasan Minto. "However, this is only an interim order. A final decision will be taken in September when the court reconvenes." The Pakistan Cricket Board, however, is confident that the 18-month ban will be upheld when the case is heard. "Today was the last working day of the courts and the courts usual give relief to petitioners just before their summer vacation," said PCB lawyer Tafazzaul Rizvi. "This is normal and it does not have a bearing on the final outcome." Shoaib was initially banned for five years in April this year by a disciplinary committee of the Pakistan Cricket Board for violating the players' code of conduct after he criticised the board for failing to offer him a new contract. Instead he was offered a retainer. The fast bowler appealed against his five-year ban last month and it was reduced to 18 months but he was still fined by a PCB panel. Shoaib then filed a petition in the Lahore high court on June 30 in a bid to overturn that verdict. "I want to play for Pakistan as soon as possible. I was disappointed with the decision on my appeal," he said after the first tribunal, before announcing his intention to appeal the decision.
