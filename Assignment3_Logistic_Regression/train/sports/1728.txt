• Kanté and Chelsea manager Antonio Conte have been in contact over deal• Midfielder has already told Leicester he wants to leave club this summer 
 Chelsea are poised to sign N’Golo Kanté after agreeing a deal with Leicester City which, with add-ons, could be worth €35m (£29.2m). Kanté has informed Leicester he wants to move to Stamford Bridge after Claudio Ranieri said it was up to the midfielder to choose. A few details need to be finalised before the transfer is announced but Chelsea’s manager, Antonio Conte, has been in touch with the France international to welcome him. Leicester are making a significant profit on Kanté, whom they signed from Caen a year ago for around £5.5m. He will be the first significant member of their title-winning squad to depart, Jamie Vardy having chosen to reject a move to Arsenal. Kanté, 25, is Conte’s second signing for Chelsea, following the striker Michy Batshuayi. The manager has indicated he wants up to two more players. Ranieri said on Thursday: “We offered Kanté a new deal before he went to the Euros. Now I know there are a lot of big teams interested. It’s in his hands.”
