 Kim Clijsters can still not turn her left wrist fully and until a couple of weeks ago needed a support for her damaged knee. Yet yesterday the former world No1 again defied medical probabilities. Clijsters reached the final of the Hastings Direct tournament by overcoming the defending champion Svetlana Kuznetsova only two months after becoming the first unseeded player ever to win back-to-back tier-one titles.  That happened after more than six months out and now, in only her second tournament since suffering ligament damage while performing the splits, the popular Belgian halted the charge of the US Open champion.  Although her 6-4, 3-6, 6-4 victory mixed strange errors with breathtaking winners, it was a match mostly of pluses for Clijsters, especially so close to Wimbledon.  "It's great to get these kind of matches and battle through,' she said. "I feel as though I've got it back."  Clijsters will be hot favourite to win today's final against an 18-year-old qualifier, Vera Douchevina. The Russian teenager is not afraid to try nasty little slices in the rallies and to follow them into the net.  Douchevina overcame the top seed Am√©lie Mauresmo on Thursday and yesterday recovered from a set and 3-5 down against Italy's Roberta Vinci to win 3-6, 7-6, 6-3 to reach the first WTA Tour final of her career.  "I like grass," said Douchevina. She certainly liked the surface when she won the Wimbledon junior title three years ago but now omitted to mention that en route she beat Maria Sharapova.
