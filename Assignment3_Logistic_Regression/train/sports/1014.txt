 Greg Rusedski will kick-start Great Britain's crucial Davis Cup World Group qualifying tie against Ecuador tomorrow.  His opening singles match against Nicolas Lapentti should be a closely contested affair, with Rusedski ranked 24th in the world and Lapentti ranked 26th.   They will be followed on court at the Club Nacional by world number nine Timmy Henman and Ecuador's Luis Adrian Morejon.   On Saturday, the British duo will play brothers Nicolas and Giovanni Lapentti in the doubles, and on Sunday the singles pairings will reverse.   The matches will be played on clay, which should favour the Ecuadoreans who are looking to repeat last year's victory over Britain at Wimbledon.   Rusedski, however, denied that the slow surface would play a big role. "Adaptation is going well and we're very professional," he said.   Henman said Guayaquil's often scalding temperatures, which can reach 36 degrees centigrade, would not be a crucial factor, as the British players were used to playing in similar conditions in Australia and the United States.   The winners of the tie will play next year in the World Group of the 101-year old competition.
