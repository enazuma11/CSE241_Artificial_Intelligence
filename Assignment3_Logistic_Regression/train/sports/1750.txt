 The Italy striker Stefano Okaka has joined Watford on a five-year deal from Anderlecht. The Premier League side announced the signing on their website but gave no financial details of the transfer. The 27-year-old helped Anderlecht to finish third in the league last season, scoring 17 goals, but has clashed with the new coach, Ren√© Weiler, according to the Belgian media. The Italian has played in the Premier League before, spending part of the 2010 season at Fulham on loan from Roma. Watford have lost two and drawn one of their opening three league games this season and are 18th of the 20 teams.
