 Leeds United are offering supporters up to a 50% refund on the net price of their season tickets next season if they fail to qualify for the Championship play-offs. While prices have been frozen for a third consecutive season, Leeds have installed an added incentive that will offer supporters a 25% refund of the net price if they fail to finish in the top six. That would rise to 50% if more than 15,000 sign up to the scheme. Leeds say the incentive is “a clear statement of our intent to gain promotion” and they are “more determined than ever” to rejoin the Premier League. However, supporters must purchase their ticket by the end of May to qualify for the offer – though the 50% reduction will still come into effect if overall sales surpass 15,000 by the end of July. Heading towards the end of another traumatic season off the pitch, with supporters continuing to call for the owner, Massimo Cellino, to leave the club, Steve Evans’s team sit 12th, 15 points adrift of the play-offs.
