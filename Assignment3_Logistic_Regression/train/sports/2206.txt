 Venus Williams blasted her way past Rita Grande of Italy 6-1 6-4 to become the first player to reach the French Open fourth round. Second seed Williams made the most of the warmest conditions of the tournament so far and never let the 27-year-old Grande settle into the match.  Grande had been vaunted as a possible tough opponent for Williams but could only watch in despair as ball after ball whizzed past her outstretched racket.  The Wimbledon and US Open champion ended Grande's first set torment in just 25 minutes. One blip in an otherwise faultless performance came as she attempted to serve out the match at 5-2 in the second set but handed Grande a break with four unforced errors.  However, the match ended just two games later when Grande weakly dumped a thundering Williams groundstroke into the net.  Williams, a shock first round loser last year, will equal her best run at Roland Garros if she defeats either Anne Kremer or Chanda Rubin to reach the quarter-finals.
