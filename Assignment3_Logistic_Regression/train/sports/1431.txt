 England have fined several players - thought to be James Anderson, Ian Bell, Jon Lewis and Liam Plunkett - for a late night drinking session just hours after losing their opening match of the World Cup against New Zealand. Several players were given the fines after admitting a breach of team discipline at a lunch-time meeting of all the squad and management. News of the previous evening's activities came to light when several British newspapers were e-mailed by fans reporting that a handful of players were out drinking to the early hours of the morning at Rumours Nightclub close to the team hotel. There is no suggestion of improper behaviour by the players but England have clamped down on them for breaching team rules.Other players were also thought to have been out but escaped disciplinary action because they returned home to their hotel at a reasonable hour. Under normal circumstances England's players are allowed to enjoy themselves providing they do not breach the strict team rules set down by the management. But with England due to play their second match in group C against Canada on Sunday, which they must win if they are to qualify for the next stage of the tournament, the management would not have wanted any players out until the early hours of the morning. Coach Duncan Fletcher has always held a relaxed view of players' social activities providing it does not impinge on their cricket and has often encouraged team outings as a method for building team spirit.
