 Andy Murray, who has not played since injuring his right wrist in the Masters Series in Hamburg more than three weeks ago, will miss the Stella Artois tournament beginning on Monday and is still a doubt for Wimbledon. The British No1 will have treatment on the injured wrist this week. He has been hitting with his coach, Brad Gilbert, and is hoping to enter the Nottingham tournament the week after Queen's Club; Tim Henman is also expected to play. "My wrist is getting better every day but it's just too soon to play," Murray said. "I've been hitting balls softly and doing strengthening exercises for it, also been getting treatment every day and working out in the gym, so hopefully it will continue to improve."
