 Argentina's Juan Monaco has written off his chances of playing in next week's Davis Cup tie against Great Britain after pulling out of the Movistar Open final in Chile with an ankle injury. The world No21 handed the title to Chilean top seed Fernando Gonzalez when he withdrew after suffering a second-degree sprain to his left ankle playing in the doubles final at the Vina del Mar event.  The disappointed 23-year-old ruled out the possibility of facing Britain after the extent of the injury emerged. "It's very unfortunate that this happened to me at such a good period of my career," he said. "I'm sad that I won't be able to play the final here in Vina del Mar and the Davis Cup tie against Great Britain next week."  Monaco's coach Francisco Mastelli added: "Juan was in a lot of pain and upset because he was unable to put his foot on the ground. I hope he can recover as soon as possible. He only has to think about recovering. We'll be arriving in Argentina on Monday to do some tests and scans." Reports in Argentina suggest Juan Ignacio Chela could replace Monaco in the Davis Cup team. Monaco's withdrawal on Saturday was the first time an ATP Tour singles final had been won by a walkover since 2003 and Gonzalez expressed his sympathy for his would-be opponent and off-court friend.  "I'm happy to have won this tournament once again but a little sad for Juan, who wasn't able to play the final," Gonzalez said. "He is a great player and even better person. It's tough for him not to be able to play the final and probably miss the Davis Cup next week. We are good friends and I hope he recovers quickly from this injury." Argentina still have three other players in the world's top 60 in David Nalbandian, Agustin Calleri and Jose Acasuso. Britain are without their top player for the tie in Buenos Aires following the withdrawal of Andy Murray with a knee problem.
