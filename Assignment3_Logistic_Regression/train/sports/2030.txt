 It is generally agreed among the leading players that Roger Federer has lifted tennis to new heights over the past couple of years, and that the only response is to work hard, and then work some more as those in pursuit attempt to narrow the gap.  Australia's Lleyton Hewitt, runner-up to the world No1 here last year, has bulked up considerably without compromising his great speed - " the best wheels in tennis", as Pete Sampras once said. He is also hitting the ball harder and serving much more effectively. This, so he hopes, will eventually pay dividends and help add to the slam titles he won here in 2001 and at Wimbledon the next year. Hewitt, with 22 other titles, is still only 24, so has every reason to remain optimistic, and yesterday opened with a 6-1, 6-2, 6-1 first-round victory over Spain's Albert Costa. Hewitt has seemingly benefited in his quarter of the draw from the withdrawal of Marat Safin with an injured knee, although he is seeded to meet Federer in the semis. "I won't worry about that until I meet him, but there's been no secret formula for anyone up against him on any surface for the last couple of years. But I'd like to get another crack." The Australian won seven of his first nine matches against Federer up to 2003 but has since lost eight in a row, including the defeat here in last year's final. "He's by himself, but trying to catch up keeps you hungry." Although the men had yet to complete their first round by the beginning of play yesterday, some of the women began second-round matches and there were wins for Russia's Maria Sharapova and Belgium's Kim Clijsters. Sharapova is top seed for the first time at a slam, although having risen to No1 in the world last week she dropped behind Lindsay Davenport on Monday. Sharapova defeated Dally Randriantefy of Madagascar 6-1, 6-0, Clijsters beat Colombia's Fabiola Zuluaga 7-5, 6-0, and Venus Williams beat Russia's Maria Kirilenko 6-1, 6-3.
