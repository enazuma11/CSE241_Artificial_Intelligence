Defending champion Jennifer Capriati was bundled out of the Australian Open after a shock 2-6, 7-6, 6-4 loss to Marlene Weingartner. Second seed Andre Agassi wasted no time brushing aside fellow American Brian Vahaly 7-5 6-3, 6-3 at the Australian Open. Anna Kournikova won her first grand slam singles match in two years with a business-like 6-1, 6-2 victory over Slovakian Henrieta Nagyova, to the relief of her legions of male fans at the Australian Open. Britain's sole interest in the Australian Open failed to last beyond the first day after Elena Baltacha was blown away by 15th seed Alexandra Stevenson.
