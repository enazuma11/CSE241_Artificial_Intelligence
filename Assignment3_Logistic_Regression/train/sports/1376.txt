 This is not a time to be dejected. Wimbledon has soared yet again, and both Andys, on Friday, served up gracious and dry courtesy afterwards. Roddick's mouthed "sorry" to the crowd displayed a self-knowledge as confident and sweet as his serve. Did the wrong Andy win? Yes, for us, but there will be other years. Also, it is too easy to forget one of Murray's major achievements: that of talent-magnet. His presence transformed the games of both Stanislas Wawrinka and then Andy Roddick: both played as never before, and gave us a week to remember all year.  Both Andys deserve thanks: but in Roddick, on the cusp of Independence Day, America can have been particularly proud of its ambassador. And we'll get him next year.
