 Venus Williams reached the last 32 of the French Open by defeating her fellow American Ashley Harkleroad, and in the process set a women's grand slam service record of 206kph (128mph). The serve was just short of the 209 kph (130mph) overall record set by Holland's Brenda Schultz-McCarthy, in Cincinnati last year. Justin Henin, the reigning champion, also reached the third round with a 7-5, 6-1 win over Austria's Tamira Paszek. It was the Belgian's 16th successive win at Roland Garros.
