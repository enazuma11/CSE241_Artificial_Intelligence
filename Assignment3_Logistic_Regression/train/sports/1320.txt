 Venus Williams (US) beat Shinobu Asagoe (Japan) 6-2, 6-3 The defending women's champion, Venus Williams, secured her place in the second round today, beating Japan's Shinobu Asagoe - a player ranked 62nd in the world. Williams began the match in stunning manner, volleying well and not conceding a point in the first nine from her serve. She won the first three games with only two points dropped but lost the next two. She fought back to win the set 6-2 but Asagoe grew in confidence. The second started badly for Williams as she stumbled to 1-3. It was by no means a comfortable afternoon for the number two seed, who had not played a match since going out of the French Open first round against Austria's Barbara Schett.  After regaining control, she went onto win with a 114mph serve which was too hot for Asagoe. Williams joins her sister, Serena, in the second round. Jamie Delgado (GBR) beat Andrei Medvedev (Ukraine) 6-2 6-4 7-5 Britain's number four, Jamie Delgado, defeated Andrei Medvedev from the Ukraine in straight sets this afternoon, and set himself up for a likely match against Andre Agassi. Medvedev, a former French Open runner-up, was defeated by Delgado's finesse on grass. The Briton's groundstrokes and volleys were too good for his opponent and, crucially, he raised his game in the second set as Medvedev threatened to get back into the match. The conversion of his fourth break point in the 12th game left Delgado serving for the match at 6-5. He wrapped up one of the finest wins of his career with an ace.
