 Lasith Malinga became the first bowler to take four wickets in four balls in international cricket as the Sri Lankan bowler threatened to steal an outrageous victiory for South Africa. Set just 210 to win South Africa looked to be crusing after Jacques Kallis 86 and Graeme Smith's 59 had taken them to 206-5. Then Malinga struck. Some superb full-length deliveries from the Sri Lankan had South Africa's last pair, Robin Peterson and man-of-the-match Charl Langeveldt, worried before they ultimately scraped the three runs required for victory. Despite the loss Sri Lanka captain Mahela Jayawardene was upbeat claiming, "From any situation we believe we can win matches and we showed that with Malinga bowling brilliantly and Murali showed what he is all about." Though he also admitted, "It was good to see the way we fought, but we didn't deserve to win this game the way we batted - that is where we probably lost this game." In stark contrast, Graeme Smith was relieved to grab victory. "I aged quite a lot out there. We went from cruising to being under pressure and the emotions in the dressing room took a big dive. He added: "This was a big game for us. Sri Lanka in these conditions were always going to be tough to beat. So it is a huge feather in our caps." However, South Africa's nervy finished showed why they are yet to completely shed their image as chokers.
