 Shashank Manohar will begin his new two-year term as International Cricket Council chairman with immediate effect, after being elected unopposed to the post. Manohar is the world governing body’s first elected independent chairman, following amendments proposed by the board at its meeting last month. The 58-year-old resigned as president of the Board of Control for Cricket in India, a requirement to be eligible for his role under new ICC regulations as its chairman. A ballot was anticipated for the honorary position, and set to be concluded by the end of this month, but has not proved necessary because Manohar was the only nominated candidate. Manohar said: “It is an honour to be elected as the chairman of the International Cricket Council – and for that I am thankful to all the ICC directors who have put their faith and trust in my abilities. I also take this opportunity to thank all my colleagues in the BCCI who have supported me during my recent time as the BCCI’s president.” He anticipates a busy time as the ICC continues its constitutional overhaul following the “Big Three” era in which principal power was invested in the Indian, English and Australian boards. “These are exciting times for international cricket as we are presently carrying out a comprehensive review of the 2014 constitutional amendments, which is aimed at not only improving governance structures but cricket structures as well,” Manohar added. “The ultimate objective is to grow our sport and engage a whole new generation of fans, and I look forward to working with all stakeholders to shape the future of cricket, which has a proud history and rich tradition.” Manohar’s tenure as chairman has commenced after the ICC’s full council also officially confirmed the abolition of the role of president – effective from next month’s annual conference in Edinburgh.
