 England women missed the chance to secure the five-match series when, chasing 224 to win the fourth one-day international against West Indies and take an unassailable 3-1 lead, they lost nine wickets for 48 to lose by 42 runs in Kingston. England were 133 for one, with the openers, Lauren Winfield and Tammy Beaumont, both having hit half-centuries. But the collapse started with Winfield’s dismissal and they were bowled out for 181. After winning the toss and electing to bat, the West Indies captain, Stafanie Taylor, hit 85 in her team’s total of 223 for six. Winfield’s second successive 50 helped England off to the perfect start but her run out, having been sent back by Heather Knight, began the collapse. Natalie Sciver was caught at midwicket for three before Danni Wyatt was run out without scoring following a mix up. Knight was involved in two more run outs, Georgia Elwiss and Katherine Brunt both returned to the pavilion cheaply, before England’s captain was out for 36 when Taylor took a terrific return catch – her third wicket. That left England 165 for eight and – after 16 more runs were added – the innings fittingly ended with some fine work from Taylor and another run out as Laura Marsh fell to the Windies captain’s direct hit.
