 Ross Hutchins has announced he is in remission from cancer. The Great Britain Davis Cup player was diagnosed with Hodgkin's lymphoma in December and underwent six months of chemotherapy at the Royal Marsden Hospital in London. Hutchins's last session was a month ago and he revealed the good news on Twitter on Monday. The 28-year-old wrote: "Was a big day today, met my Oncologist and I am now in remission :) So grateful to fantastic Professor Cunningham and his team @royalmarsden Andy Murray dedicated his win at the Brisbane International in January to Hutchins, one of his best friends. During his treatment, Hutchins was so grateful to the team at the Royal Marsden that he organised the Rally Against Cancer to raise money for them with the campaign culminating in a doubles match on finals day at Queen's when Murray and Tim Henman beat Ivan Lendl and Tomas Berdych.
