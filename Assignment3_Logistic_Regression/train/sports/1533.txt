 England's upcoming one-day international series against Australia is in some doubt following a pay dispute. Cricket Australia and their players have been locked in discussions about new performance-related contracts for the past 12 months, with a 30 June deadline now fast approaching. The opening match of the five-game ODI series takes place on 29 June, and the Australians are due to fly out to England in the next fortnight. Any prospect of a potential player strike before then would therefore seem remote, with players unlikely to take such action while still at the negotiating table, and a refusal to tour is then only likely to be an option while the Australians are already in England. Despite that, a boycott remains a possibility, with reports in Australia suggesting players had examined the option of sitting out the England series. The Australian Cricketers' Association chief executive officer, Paul Marsh, has also admitted that contingency plans are being made should the deadline pass. "There's only 29 days of negotiations left to run, so we are preparing for the eventuality of not having a deal in place before the end of July," he told The Australian. "We are looking at all of our different options." Australia are due to play their opening tour match against Leicestershire on 21 June, with a one-day international against Ireland scheduled on 23 June before the England series. Ireland have announced they will play a three-match Twenty20 series against Bangladesh in Belfast next month, which will begin Ireland's preparations for the World Twenty20, which will be staged in Sri Lanka from September. "It's great news that we're taking on Bangladesh, and the games will give us valuable preparation as we build towards the World Cup in Sri Lanka," Phil Simmons, the Ireland coach, said.
