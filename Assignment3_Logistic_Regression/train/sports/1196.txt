 Andy Roddick, in his first tournament since splitting with Jimmy Connors as coach, reached Dubai Open final by beating Novak Djokovic. The former world No1 denied that the separation from Connors had given him any extra motivation, though his form in winning 7-6, 6-3 against the Australian Open champion was even better than when beating Rafael Nadal the previous night. "I don't know if this week is about Jimmy. I talked to him last night and he had a lot of things to say," said Roddick. "But for a long time it has been John [Roddick's brother], Doug [Spreen] and me on the road." Roddick served superbly and played some clever rallies, but the match hinged on a forehand miss by Djokovic in the tie-break and one break of serve in the second set.
