 Samantha Stosur, whose career was placed at risk by a tick bite which gave her a rare ailment called Lyme disease, secured the first Wimbledon title of her career while still in the early stages of her comeback. The Australian had returned in April and yesterday partnered the American Bob Bryan to become unseeded winners of the mixed doubles title in some of the darkest conditions in which a Wimbledon final can ever have finished. Stosur's illness sometimes affects the skin, heart, joints and nervous system and created all sorts of ugly anxieties as well as kept her sidelined for seven months. "I'm not expecting too much too soon," she had said but now was securing the most notable triumph of her career by winning 7-5, 6-4 over Bob's twin Mike Bryan and Katarina Srebotnik of Slovenia. This reversed the result of the brothers' previous encounter in a grand slam final, when Bob had partnered Srebotnik in the US Open six years ago, and Mike, two minutes the older sibling, had prevailed. It was often played in a light-hearted spirit, which was perhaps a little surprising given the Bryans' early years together. "We played every day after school on the practice courts and we always tried to kill each other. We were always at each other's throats," said Bob. By the end it was so dark that extra light was cast on the court by the stadium corridor lights. And Bob once took a tumble when looking to make a return to a ball which was simply not there. The day before, another Serbian thrust himself into the limelight, Nenad Zimonjic being the man of the match as he and Daniel Nestor overcame Jonas Bjorkman and Kevin Ullyett 7-6, 6-7, 6-3, 6-3 in the men's doubles final. It denied Bjorkman a title in his last Wimbledon and gave Nestor the full set of four grand slam titles but was Zimonjic's first in men's doubles. "Last year Jelena Jankovic won here in the mixed doubles [with Jamie Murray]," Zimonjic said. "Before that we never had anyone as champion. That's big for me."
